Freedom {Waley says this endearing and enduring vision “can be understood in the past, present, or future tense, as the reader desires.” This is always true of the vision of the golden age, the humane society.Christian or Cartesian dualism, the division of spirit or mind from the material body and world, existed long before Christianity or Descartes and was never limited to Western thought (though it is the “craziness” or “sickness” that many people under Western domination see in Western civilization). Lao Tzu thinks the materialistic dualist, who tries to ignore the body and live in the head, and the religious dualist, who despises the body and lives for a reward in heaven, are both dangerous and in danger. So, enjoy your life, he says; live in your body, you are your body; where else is there to go? Heaven and earth are one. As you walk the streets of your town you walk on the Way of heaven.}

Let there be a little country without many people.

Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred,

and never use them.

Let them be mindful of death

and disinclined to long journeys.

They’d have ships and carriages,

![[Texts/老子/老子80#^KR5c0057xtlsx080-1az9]]
but no place to go.

![[Texts/老子/老子80#^KR5c0057xtlsx080-1az10]]
They’d have armor and weapons,

![[Texts/老子/老子80#^KR5c0057xtlsx080-1az11]]
but no parades.

![[Texts/老子/老子80#^KR5c0057xtlsx080-1az12]]
Instead of writing, they might go back to using knotted cords.

They’d enjoy eating,

devoted to their customs.

The next little country might be so close

the people could hear cocks crowing and dogs barking there,

![[Texts/老子/老子80#^KR5c0057xtlsx080-1az19]]
but they’d get old and die without ever having been there.
