Imagining mystery {I’d like to call the “something” of the first line a lump—an unshaped, undifferentiated lump, chaos, before the Word, before Form, before Change. Inside it is time, space, everything; in the womb of the Way.The last words of the chapter, tzu jan, I render as “what is.” I was tempted to say, “The Way follows itself,” because the Way is the way things are; but that would reduce the significance of the words. They remind us not to see the Way as a sovereignty or a domination, all creative, all yang. The Way itself is a follower. Though it is before everything, it follows what is.}

There is something that contains everything.

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az4]]
Before heaven and earth it is.

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az5]]
Oh, it is still, unbodied,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az6]]
all on its own, unchanging,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az7]]
all-pervading, ever-moving.

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az8]]
So it can act as the mother of all things.

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az9]]
Not knowing its real name,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az10]]
we only call it the Way.

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az11]]
If it must be named, let its name be Great.

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az12]]
Greatness means going on,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az13]]
going on means going far,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az14]]
and going far means turning back.

  ![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az15]]
So they say: “The Way is great,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az16]]
heaven is great,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az17]]
earth is great,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az18]]
and humankind is great;

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az19]]
four greatnesses in the world,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az20]]
and humanity is one of them.”

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az21]]
People follow earth,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az22]]
earth follows heaven,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az23]]
heaven follows the Way,

![[Texts/老子/老子25#^KR5c0057xtlsx025-1az24]]
the Way follows what is.
