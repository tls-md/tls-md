People of power {In the first stanza we see the followers of the Way in ancient times or illo tempore, remote and inaccessible; but the second stanza brings them close and alive in a series of marvelous similes. (I am particularly fond of the polite and quiet houseguests.) The images of the valley and of uncut or uncarved wood will recur again and again.}

Once upon a time people who knew the Way

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az4]]
were subtle, spiritual, mysterious, penetrating,

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az5]]
unfathomable.

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az6]]
Since they’re inexplicable

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az7]]
I can only say what they seemed like:

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az8]]
Cautious, oh yes, as if wading through a winter river.

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az9]]
Alert, as if afraid of the neighbors.

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az10]]
Polite and quiet, like houseguests.

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az11]]
Elusive, like melting ice.

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az12]]
Blank, like uncut wood.

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az13]]
Empty, like valleys.

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az14]]
Mysterious, oh yes, they were like troubled water.

  ![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az15]]
Who can by stillness, little by little make what is troubled grow clear?

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az16]]
Who can by movement, little by little make what is still grow quick?

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az17]]
To follow the Way

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az18]]
is not to need fulfillment.

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az19]]
Unfulfilled, one may live on

![[Texts/老子/老子15#^KR5c0057xtlsx015-1az20]]
needing no renewal.
