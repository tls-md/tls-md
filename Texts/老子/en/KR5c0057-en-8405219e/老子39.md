Integrity

Those who of old got to be whole:

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az4]]
Heaven through its wholeness is pure;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az5]]
earth through its wholeness is steady;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az6]]
spirit through its wholeness is potent;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az7]]
the valley through its wholeness flows with rivers;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az8]]
the ten thousand things through their wholeness live;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az9]]
rulers through their wholeness have authority.

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az10]]
Their wholeness makes them what they are.

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az11]]
Without what makes it pure, heaven would disintegrate;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az12]]
without what steadies it, earth would crack apart;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az13]]
without what makes it potent, spirit would fail;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az14]]
without what fills it, the valley would run dry;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az15]]
without what quickens them, the ten thousand things would die;

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az16]]
without what authorizes them, rulers would fall.

  ![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az17]]
The root of the noble is in the common,

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az18]]
the high stands on what’s below.

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az19]]
Princes and kings

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az20]]
call themselves “orphans, widowers, beggars,”

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az21]]
to get themselves rooted in the dirt.

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az22]]

A multiplicity of riches is poverty.

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az24]]
Jade is praised as precious,

![[Texts/老子/老子39#^KR5c0057xtlsx039-1az25]]
but its strength is being stone.
