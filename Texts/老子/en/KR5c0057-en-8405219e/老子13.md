Shameless {Lao Tzu, a mystic, demystifies political power.Autocracy and oligarchy foster the beliefs that power is gained magically and retained by sacrifice, and that powerful people are genuinely superior to the powerless.Lao Tzu does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped. He does not see power as virtue, but as the result of virtue. The democracies are founded on that view.He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anybody who follows the Way. This is a radically subversive attitude. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends.}

I suffer because I’m a body;

if I weren’t a body,

![[Texts/老子/老子13#^KR5c0057xtlsx013-1az13]]
how could I suffer?

So people who set their bodily good before the public good

![[Texts/老子/老子13#^KR5c0057xtlsx013-1az15]]
could be entrusted with the commonwealth,

![[Texts/老子/老子13#^KR5c0057xtlsx013-1az16]]
and people who treated the body politic as gently as their own body

![[Texts/老子/老子13#^KR5c0057xtlsx013-1az17]]
would be worthy to govern the commonwealth.
