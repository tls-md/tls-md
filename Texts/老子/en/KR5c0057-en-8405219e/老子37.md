Over all {Here the themes of not doing and not wanting, the unnamed and the unshapen, recur together in one pure legato. It is wonderful how by negatives and privatives Lao Tzu gives a sense of serene, inexhaustible fullness of being.}

The Way never does anything,

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az4]]
and everything gets done.

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az5]]
If those in power could hold to the Way,

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az6]]
the ten thousand things would look after themselves.

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az7]]
If even so they tried to act,

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az8]]
I’d quiet them

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az9]]
with the nameless, the natural.

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az10]]
In the unnamed, in the unshapen,

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az11]]
is not wanting.

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az12]]
In not wanting is stillness.

![[Texts/老子/老子37#^KR5c0057xtlsx037-1az13]]
In stillness all under heaven rests.
