One power {Where shall we find a ruler wise enough to know what to teach and what to withhold? “Once upon a time,” maybe, in the days of myth and legend, as a pattern, a model, an ideal?The knowledge and the ignorance or unknowing Lao Tzu speaks of may or may not refer to what we think of as education. In the last stanza, by power he evidently does not mean political power at all, but something vastly different, a unity with the power of the Tao itself.This is a mystical statement about government—and in our minds those two realms are worlds apart. I cannot make the leap between them. I can only ponder it.}

Once upon a time those who ruled according to the Way

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az4]]
didn’t use it to make people knowing

but to keep them unknowing.

People get hard to manage

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az7]]
when they know too much.

Whoever rules by intellect

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az9]]
is a curse upon the land.

Whoever rules by ignorance

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az11]]
is a blessing on it.

To understand these things

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az13]]
is to have a pattern and a model,

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az14]]
and to understand the pattern and the model

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az15]]
is mysterious power.

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az16]]
Mysterious power goes deep.

It reaches far.

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az18]]
It follows things back,

![[Texts/老子/老子65#^KR5c0057xtlsx065-1az19]]
clear back to the great oneness.
