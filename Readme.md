This repository contains in an #obsidian vault a Markdown version of the TLS dataset, exported from the repository [tls-data](https://github.com/tls-kr/tls-data) (this repo is not yet public.).  The same dataset can also be accessed at [HXWD.org](https://hxwd.org)

To use the vault, go to the [Obsidian website](https://obsidian.md) and download the application, download or clone this repository and use Obsidian on your local computer to open this repository as a vault. 

Be aware that this is currently in a pretty early stage and is mainly intended for use by the project members.  Specifically, there are not yet any user interface elements and the data format is pretty bar-bone. 

However, feedback from everybody is welcome!

Here are some entry points to consider:

- [[About]] this repository, together with other notes in the TLS/Documentation folder.
- [[Top level syntactic functions]] 
- [[TLS/Concepts|Concepts]]
- A sample text: [[老子]] with some annotations and translation
- A short introduction is available in `oricom2024-wittern.pdf`
