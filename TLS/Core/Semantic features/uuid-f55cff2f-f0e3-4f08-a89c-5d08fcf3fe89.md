# act

This category covers both finite actions and "on-going" activities. The criterion
                    determining whether something is an actiivty or not is whether it is construed
                    as involving the agent's intentions or not. Thus "falling" is not normally an
                    activity, but sky-diving is.



NOTA BENE

The subcategorisation of actions into durative, conative, perfective, iterative,
                    inchoative, ingressive etc., etc. has not been attempted in any systematic way
                    so far, largely because in the end it will involve a considerable effort of
                    dividing a given lexeme entry into various lexeme entries specified for their
                    durative, conative semantic features.
