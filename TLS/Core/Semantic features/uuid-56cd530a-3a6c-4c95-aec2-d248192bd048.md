# tr

The semantic feature tr is attributed when a verb (or occasionally a noun) has a
                    semantic structure that essentially involves reference to an object although
                    according to the principles of the syntactic description it is classified as
                    intransitive.

NB: The implementation of this semantic category has still not been tried out in
                    any detail and presents all sorts of problems.
