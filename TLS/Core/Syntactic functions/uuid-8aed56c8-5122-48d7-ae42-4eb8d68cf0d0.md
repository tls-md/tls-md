# S

A verbal or nominal or grammaticalised expression that functions as a complete sentence. In classical Chinese grammar embedded S are nearly always specifically V{S}. It will be important to collect counterexamples to this generalisation.



S refers to a constrution headed by or identical with a predicative phrase, i.e. headed by what in a general way one might write as V{PRED} or N{PRED}.
