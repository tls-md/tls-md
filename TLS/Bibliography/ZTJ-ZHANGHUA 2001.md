# Note
715 pages; The edition includes two lengthy introductions to ZTJ, one at the beginning and one at the end. The one in the beginning is identical with Yang Zengwen 1999: 575-609. A superficial check of the edition reveals that most of the mistakes in WU have been corrected. However, a few inaccuracies seem to remain. The notes in this critical edition are very useful. One of the weaknesses of this edition is that the Chinese graphs were converted into modern simplified graphs, a procedure which is not useful for the edition of a text like ZTJ. The number of simplified graphs in ZTJ is very limited and their shape is often not identical with their modern counterparts.
