# Note
Singularly highly readable argumentative edition accompanied by an indispensable index to 5 editions of the book, and preceded by a lucidly argued methodological introduction.This is not just a commentary on Laozi, but an extremely rich collection of detailed discussions on issues raised by the Laozi.
