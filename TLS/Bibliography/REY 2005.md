# Note
This is a very philosophically orientated conceptual dictionary "on the occasion of the French language" by the greatest of modern French lexicographers, Alain Rey, who has here allowed himself to compile a dictionary entirely to his own analytic taste. The book is full of important global conceptual surveys on chosen topics.
