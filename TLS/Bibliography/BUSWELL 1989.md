**The Formation of Ch'an Ideology in China and Korea** :LatnThe Vajrasamādhi-Sūtra, a Buddhist Apocryphon
# Note
This is an excellent study of early Chan/Zen thought, examplified by an apocryphon important for the formation of the early Zen school. Buswell discusses the development of the theories about the nature of consciousness in a historical perspective, from the 6th cent. until the 8th cent./early 9th cent. when the particular Chinese notion of Buddha nature and inherent enlightenment took form. Buswell argues that the Vajrasamaadhi-Suutra was written by a Korean monk, a theory which is still discussed today.
