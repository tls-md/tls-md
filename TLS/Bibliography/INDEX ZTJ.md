# Note
1740 pages!! Between 1980 and 1982 there appeared a work which had great influence on the research on ZTJ. This was the monumental three-volume index to ZTJ ('Sōdōshū sakuin 祖堂集索引'). This work was based on Yanagida's habit of producing a card for every word and phrase in ZTJ. Finally there were ten-thousands of cards which he had collected over a period of more than twenty years. These cards became the basis for the edition of the Index.
