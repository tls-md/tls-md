# Note
trad. attributed to AsSvagoSsa. This apocryphon (6th century?) was one of the most influential scriptures for the formation of the sinitic Buddhist schools during the Tang; the main doctrine is the description and analysis of the One Mind 一心 and its pure and tainted aspects. Translated and annotated in HAKEDA 1967.
