# Note
This text was written by the Japanese monk Ennin who came to China in 838 where he stayed until 847. He traveled to several places, got aquainted with a number of teachings of Chinese Buddhism, learned Sanskrit and Chinese. He recorded his observations regarding many aspects of Chinese culture and his encounters during his travels in form of a diary. A handwritten manuscript of the text was not discovered before the 20th century. For a analysis of the semantics of the text see Dong Zhiqiao 2000; the text was translated into English by Reischauer, Edwin O.: Ennin's Diary. Ronald Press 1955; see also Reischauer, Edwin O.: Ennin's Travels in Tang China. Ronald Press 1955
