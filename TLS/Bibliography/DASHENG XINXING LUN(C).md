# Note
this is a complete and heavily annotated translation into German; the text is also placed in the context of similar texts of the early 8th cent.; orig. on PELLIOT 3559, plates 28-33; the attribution to Sengchou (480-560) is very doubtful and the text was probably composed in the beginning of the 8th century by members of the early Chán School.
