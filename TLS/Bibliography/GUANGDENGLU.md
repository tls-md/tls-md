# Note
This text was compiled during the tiān-shèng 天聖 era (1023-1032) by Lǐ Zūnxù 李遵勗 (988-1038; see SONGSHI: 13567-13569; biographic information see also in WITTERN 2002: 138-139); the compilation was completed in ca. 1029 but was somewhat revised afterwards; in 1036 a preface by Renzong (1022-1063) was included; the work was soon included in the official Buddhist canon and the first extant printed version dates from 1148 (printed at the Kāiyuán 開源 monastery in Fú province); see WITTERN 2002: 136.
