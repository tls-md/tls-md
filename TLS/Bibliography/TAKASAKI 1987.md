**An Introduction to Buddhism** :Latn
# Note
This is a translation of Takasaki 1983. The book is a good introduction to Buddhist doctrines, concentrating on the historical develpments in Chinese Buddhism. The main concerns of the author are without doubt the development of the Tathagatagarbha/ Buddha-nature theorires and the understanding of consciousness/mind in Chinese Buddist schools.
