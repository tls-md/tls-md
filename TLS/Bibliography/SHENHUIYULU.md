Full title: Húshì jiào Dūnhuáng Táng xiěběn Shénhuì héshàng yíjí 胡適校敦煌唐寫本神會和尚遺集; in 1925 Húshì travelled to London and Paris and examined the Dūnhuáng manuscripts there; among the Pelliot manuscripts he discovered three new texts connected to the monk Shénhuì which he critically edited. Especially Húshì's  introduction Hézé dà-shī Shénhuì zhuàn 荷澤大師神會傳 shed new light on the influence of this monk on the early Chán school. The book edits the following texts and text-fragments: (a) Shénhuì yǔ-lù dìyī cán-juàn 神會語錄第一殘卷 [First Text Fragment of the Recorded Sayings of Shénhuì; Pelliot 3047 (first part); the second part which consists of questions and answers  is probably a record of the criticism on the Northern School of Chán which was initiated by Shénhuì during his stay at the Kāiyuán 開元 monastery in the beginning of the 8th century; (b)  Shénhuì yǔ-lù dì-èr cán-juàn 神會語錄第二殘卷 (PELLIOT 3047); (c) Pútídámó nán-zōng dìng shì-fēi lùn bìng xù 菩提達摩南宗定是非論並序; (d) Shénhuì yǔ-lù dì-sān cán-juàn 神會語錄第三殘卷 (PELLIOT 3488); (e) Dùn-wù wú-shēng bō-rě sòng cán juàn (STEIN 468); appendix: Hézé Shénhuì dà-shī yǔ 荷澤神會大師語 (from the entry on Shénhuì in JDCDL); for a translation of the texts see Gernet 1949; there is a reprint of Húshì's book which was published in 1968 at Zhōngyāng yánjiū yuàn Húshì jìniàn guǎnkān 中央研究院胡適紀念館刊 under the same title (with the addition fù Húshì xiānshēng wǎnnián de yánjiū 附胡適先生晚年的研究); information based on ZENSEKI KAIDAI: 450, no. 29, 30.
