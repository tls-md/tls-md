The Thesaurus Linguae Sericae (TLS) is a analytical tool for pre-modern Chinese started by Christoph Harbsmeier in the 1990s.  It was originally using a Filemaker database; since 2019 the editing process has been moved to an online database at [HXWD.org](https://hxwd.org) this time named for the Chinese name of the TLS, which is 漢學文典.
