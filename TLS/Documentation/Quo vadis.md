# Where do we go from here?

The question at some point will be how to proceed. 

## Relationship of the two projects

In an early phase of discussions about this project, we started to call this the **TLS-Satellite** and the established website the **Mothership**, in a way like a small explorer ship will leave a space ship to explore a newly found planet, but with a limited load of supplies and facilities and the prospect of returning after a few days. 

As things are proceeding now, I think there is room for more independence here, so it might be more appropriate to call this now the **TLS Companion** -- exploring the space alongside the older ship, seeing with new eyes and bringing qualities to the undertaking that will benefit the whole, which consists of both projects and more. 

## Workgroup anyone?

If this seems agreeable, I would like to establish a task force or working group that could oversee the further development here. We might schedule meetings outside of this group, but probably mostly communicate through Mail, GitHub and the like.  We could even see if we can find another discussion method that could be pressed into service for the whole project.

## Changes in both directions

Once the format on both sides has been confirmed, pipelines can be established to ensure flow of information in both directions.  Cleaning up the Concept files, or make the Syntactical functions consistent and well documented are tasks that can be much easier be completed in an editor, rather than in the browser.  In addition to that, we can also use this opportunity to implement an editorial pipeline, where changes are signed off before becoming pushed to the website. This would complete a transition from a one-person-project to a true collaborative project that has been in the making for a long time.
