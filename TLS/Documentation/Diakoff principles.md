These principles have been laid out by Harry Diakoff after a lengthy study of the current TLS system and are meant to inform strategies for further development of the project.  They have been delivered orally at the meeting of [2024-06-14](https://hxwd.org/seminar/index.html#org510bb95) under the title "Near term and long term changes to the TLS: benefits and costs"; this write-up is not by Harry, but rather by #chris .

## Speed 
- the system should at any point respond as quickly as possible. 

## Flexibility
- Utmost flexibility with respect to display and usage of the data is desirable.  
- The phrase boundaries (colon boundaries, as Harry called them) should be malleable and not carved in stone due to the way the system is designed.
- Multiple views of a texts should be possible.
- Multiple ways of markup should be possible, which might suggest use of standoff markup.
- Cross linking on many levels to other resources should be possible.
## Discussion 
- Users should be encouraged to engage in discussion about the interpretation presented here and not take them as given.
- Such discussion threads should be possible for annotations, translation, edits etc.
## Pedagogical dimension
- The system has a great potential for use at every level of engagement with the language.
- For learners of Chinese.
- For students of linguistic annotation.
- For operators who want to learn the details of how to apply the descriptive and analytical tools. 

Harry's presentation actually had a lot more to it, but this is just a very sketchy outline.
