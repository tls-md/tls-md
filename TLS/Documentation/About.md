The content of this repository is a snapshot of the [[TLS/Documentation/TLS|TLS on HXWD]] created 2024-06-18. It is an attempt to provide access to this database with minimal efforts.  The database, which is maintained in XML format, has been exported to a static set of interlinked files in [[Markdown]] format.  It is also informed by the [[Diakoff principles]], but does not implement them in a slavish way -- here the emphasis is most emphatically on the second principle, **flexibility**. This flexibility is to a great deal achieved by using an editor, rather than a web browser, which will allow the user to change everything (and find out which changes actually break the system...). 

For the display interface, an existing application called [[Obsidian]] is used.  While this is **not** an open source program, it is available free of charge on computers running *Linux*, *MacOS* or Windows operating systems and on mobile platforms running iOS, iPadOS or Android. Although Markdown is a widely used text format, the files available here make use of constructs that are not generally supported in other applications, and therefore can only be used with Obsidian. 
As of this writing, only **some** core elements of the TLS have been exported, which includes
- Concepts
- Bibliography
- TLS Lexical entities ('Words')
- Syntactic functions
For the time being, we will call this combination of a set of Markdown files (which in Obsidian are called a 'vault') and the application Obsidian, which operates on this **[[tls-md]]**.  

`tls-md` is an attempt to make using the TLS easier for new users, and to allow experimenting with new ways of presenting the data to the user and annotating the texts. 

While the parts that have been included here are in itself complete, there is only a very small number of texts available at the moment. 

Here are some [[Use cases|use cases]] that drives the development.
