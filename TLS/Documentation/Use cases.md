How can this resource be used? Here is a number of envisioned use cases:
1. Add annotations.  This can be (a) done with a text that has been exported from the [[TLS]] and (b) with any other text that has been copied to this vault. 
2. Experiment with new ways to display the data: Since all of this can be edited, it is very easy to use this as a base to create mockups to communicate desired ways of displaying the material.  
3. Add translations.
4. As a research tool in addition to and beyond the scope of the TLS. It is possible to create research notes and link material from the database
5. A teacher could make a derived version of this for her class.
