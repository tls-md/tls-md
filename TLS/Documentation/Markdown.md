A very simple text format, named in contrast to formats based on markup languages such as XML or HTML. It uses only a few special syntactic constructs to make it possible to  represent headings, lists, links, bold or italic text.

Originally proposed by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz  in 2004, there is no standard body overseeing its development, which lead to a variety of variants.
