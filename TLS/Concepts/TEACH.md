# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for training, instructing, and disciplining others is jiào 教 (ant. xué 學 "study") and the standard main aim of jiào 教 is unquestioning obedience, professional skill, and intellectual conformity to the standard set by the teacher, and the word connotes use of authority and sometimes even coercion. The primary aim of jiào 教 is action conforming to a standard, and the word is commonly nominalised.
2. Huì 誨 (ant. xí 習 "study persistently") refers to systematic and persistent efforts to teach and inculcate intellectual or practical skills ( 誨之琴 "taught him to play the zither") and moral understanding of students ( 誨女知之 "I will teach you so you understand"), and the word never implies coercion or any threat of force. Huì 誨 can be mutual, or refer to equals teaching equals, even subordinates teaching superiors 諫誨 "remonstrate with and instruct". The word is not commonly nominalised. The primary aim of huì 誨 is understanding.
3. Huà 化 refers to successful disciplining and teaching, typically on a large social scale. See INFLUENCE
4. Qǐ 啟 and fā 發 refer to the opening up of new intellectual and moral dimensions for others.
5. Xùn 訓 refers in a rather abstract way to formal strict instruction and training aimed primarily at professional skill.
6. Zhào 詔 refers to instruction by means of useful information or warning.
7. Fēng 風 is occasionally used to refer to teaching by example.
8. Liàn 練 refers specifically to military training and only occasionally to other forms of drill.
9. Dào 道 refers to the content of what is taught, and is largely restricted to postnominal position, as in 儒道 "Confucian teaching".

教，誨
1. WL claims that both mean 教導 and that the special feature of jia4o 教 is the element of coercion qia2ngzhi4 強制. In fact, one is practical instruction and training, not normally focussing on the coercion or even the threat of force, and the other is intellectual teaching. 
Occasionally, jia4o 教 does have a general meaning where even a subordinate can jia4o 教 a ruler, the point being not coercion or even power, but rather professional or technical (rather than moral) authority:
