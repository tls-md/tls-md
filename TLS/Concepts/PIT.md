# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for a fairly large hole in the ground is kēng [[坑]].
2. Kū [[窟]] refers to an artificial cavity large enough to serve as a habitat for humans.
3. Jiào [[窖]]／[[窌]] refers to a pit usually designed for storage of grain.
4. Jǐng [[阱]] is a hole in the ground -typically like a well- designed as a trap.
5. Kǎn [[坎]]／[[埳]] is any hole in the ground designed as a trap.
NB:. Huò [[壑]] refers to a large abyss or crevice and is marginal to this group because it is not man-made.
