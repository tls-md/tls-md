# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[CYCLIC/LINEAR]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[INCREASING/STATIC]
[SUBJ=HUMAN/SUBJ=NON-HUMAN]
1. Fù 復 tends to refer to a cyclic repetition of any any event, action, or process.
[CYCLIC!], [GENERAL]
2. Yòu 又 refers to linear repetition, often of an incremental nature, of any event, action, or process (compare LAO 玄之又玄 "even more mysterious than the mysterious".
[GENERAL], [INCREASING!], [LINEAR]
3. Zài 再 refers generally to linear repetition of the same action, typically by a human agent.
[GENERAL], [LINEAR], [SUBJ=HUMAN!]
4. Gèng 更 in front of transitive verbs typically implies a change of object and thus often retains elements of its original force "improve", and the word often retains the nuance of an intended systematic improvement achieved by the change.
[SPECIFIC], [SUBJ=HUMAN]
5. Xí 襲 refers to repetition by way of a continuation of a traditIon. See REPEAT.
[LINEAR], [SPECIFIC], [SUBJ=HUMAN]
## Modern Chinese Criteria
再 is the current modern word for "again" and its meaning derives from the meaning "twice", and the repeated action is typically (but not always) in the future.
又 contrasts notoriously with 再 in many other meanings, but when it means "again", the reference is typically to a repeated action in the past or in the present. [Add references to the extensive literature on this distinction.]
復 (lit) "again" is current only in epistolary style.
重複
再三
來回
又要 refers to repeated action in the future.
還 does not primarily refer to repetition but to doing something X in addition to something else Y.
重 chóng "repeatedly" is usually a bound form in modern Chinese.
反覆 "again and again" focusses on multiple repetition.
一再 is idiomatic for continuous repetition.
再三 is idiomatic for continuous repetition.
再三再四 is idiomatic for continuous repetition.
連連

還
更

再次
重新
從新

## 
1. Fù 復 can be negated to mean "no more, no longer" (Ban Zhao, NJ); yòu 又 cannot be so negated.
2. Fù 復 can refer to regaining things (CC fù sū 復穌 "come to life again"); yòu 又 cannot be so used.
3. Fù 復 always refers to the repetition of the same kind of action; yòu 又 can refer to the same kind of action, but it can also present a list of significantly comparable actions.
4. When the particles link to occurrences of basically the same event, then difference between them is that fù 復 invites us to dwell on the sameness of the events, and yòu 又 invites us to dwell on their separate occurrence. Since yòu 又 emphasises the difference in this case, it is natural that the word can also be used when in fact the events show considerable difference.
5. Fù dé 復得 is "to retrieve", yòu dé 又得 is "to get another one".
6. Fù shēng 復生 "be reborn" and gèng shēng 更生 "be born again" (ZHUANG 19), sù shēng 甦生 "be born again" contrasts with yòu shēng 又生 "also give birth to"
7. Fù lì 復立 "arise anew" contrasts with yòu lì 又立 "establish in addition" and gèng lì 更立 "establish as replacement".

1. WL claims that za4i 再 always means "twice" and claims that the word only came to mean "again" in the 近代 period.  In fact, za4i 再 certainly does often mean "twice", but there is a wide range of current cases where the word means not "twice" but "a second time".  Significantly, even the SHUOWEN explanation of the word suggests this second meaning.
2. WL does not begin to appreciate the basic differences between the two words for again.  WL 99 glosses yo4u 又 as fu4 復.  Compare this identification of meaning with the contrasts elaborated in SSC under the heading of AGAIN.
