# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
It is interesting to note that all the words below are only rarely used to mean "chew" in ancient Chinese texts. And most words seem to belong more naturally into the group BITE.
1. Jué 嚼 and jǔ 咀 are rare and late words for "to chew", but jǔ 咀 also has a more general meaning "to eat".
2. Shì 噬 focusses on intense mastication and biting into food, and the word often includes the meaning of swallowing what one has chewed intensely.
3. Yǎo 咬 merely refers to the biting into something, and secondarily the chewing over of it, but the word never refers to swallowing.
4. Bǔ 哺 is first attested in TANG and involves a very mild degree of mastication or chewing, and often includes semantically the subsequent swallowing of food.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
嚼 is the current modern word for to chew.
咀嚼 jǔjué is a more literary word which has many figurative meanings.
反芻 refers to regurgitation.
倒嚼 is a more colourless term for regurgitation.
