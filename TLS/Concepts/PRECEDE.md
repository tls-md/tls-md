# Definition
EARLY IN-RELATION-TO something.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current word for being first or coming first in time, or for being first in the order of importance, is xiān 先 (ant. hòu 後 "later").
2. Chū 初 (ant. zú 卒 "finally" and zhōng 終 "end") refers to the very first stage in a historical development, and the word never has any abstract reference to an order of importance. See also BEGIN
3. Shǒu 首 (ant. mò 末 "final point"(and sometimes in nominal usages wěi 尾 "tail end")) sometimes refers to the first person to do something important.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
預先 is the current modern adverb for "first".
先 is equally current but perhaps a little less formal.
先行
前導
先期
