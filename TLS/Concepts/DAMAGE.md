# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. By far the commonest general word for damage is hài 害 (ant. lì 利 "benefit").
2. Shāng 傷 "impair" and sǔn 損 "reduce and impair" (all ant. yì 益 "strengthen") are weaker than hài 害 and definitely suggest the survival of what is impaired.
3. Zéi 賊 is stronger than hài 害 and definitely suggests that the damage done is serious indeed - possibly fatal.
