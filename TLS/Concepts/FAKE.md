# Definition
CREATE SOMETHING WHICH PRETENDS TO BE WHAT IT IS NOT.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for faking something is jiǎo [[矯]] and the typical focus is on fraudulence involved.
2. Wěi [[偽]] (ant. zhēn [[真]] ) focusses on the artificiality rather than natural or proper provenance of the product.
3. Xū [[虛]] (ant. shí [[實]] ) focusses on the insubstantiality of the product, and the word is normally used adnominally.
NB: Jiǎ [[假]] (ant. zhēn [[真]] ) focusses on something standing in for something else that is the genuine thing, but this usage was late to develop (HOUHANSHU).
