# Definition
SHAPE that is NOT STRAIGHT.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard general word for anything bent or curved rather than straight is qǔ [[曲]] (ant. zhí [[直]] "straight"), and this word has a range of metaphorical uses.
2. Qū [[屈]] refers to something being bent or twisted and therefore not stretched out to its full potential length (ant. shēn [[伸]] "stretch out") is mostly literal in meaning, except when referring to being bowed down by humiliation.
3. Wān [[彎]] refers to naturally curved objects of any kind without any suggestion of them having been bent into this shape.
4. Yǔ [[傴]] refers especially to the deformation of the human body through various diseases which cause humans to have curved backs. See HUNCHBACK
5. Gōu [[枸]] refers especially to bent wood without any indication of why this wood has become bent.
6. Róu [[輮]] is a rare word referring - always very literally - to the bending (especially of wood) into round shape and the resulting bent shape of wood.
