SPEAK:say that something that has been SAID is UNTRUE.
## Definition
SPEAK:say that SOMETHING is NOT TRUE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. There are no common words for denial in pre-Buddhist Chinese. Fēi 非 has declarative transitive uses, I think, but I have not yet identified a clear relevant example.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
否定 is the current modern word for denial.
否決 is to make or pass a decision against something.
