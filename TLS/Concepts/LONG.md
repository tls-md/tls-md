# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The dominant general term for length is cháng [[長]] (ant. duǎn [[短]] "short").
2. Xiū [[修]] / [[脩]] is Chu dialect for "long". The word is often used as a taboo equivalent for cháng [[長]] when the latter has to be avoided because it is the name of an emperor.
3. Zhāng [[張]] (ant. suō [[縮]] "shortened") refers to something that is longer than expected or longer than it was before.
4. Yōu [[悠]] can occasionally refer to something being long so as to take a long time to pass through. See ENDURING
5. Màn màn [[漫漫]] refers to something having a long horizontal extension. See ENDURING
