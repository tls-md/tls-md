# Definition
At MANY TIMES.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for high frequency of an event within a certain period of time is shuò [[數]] " several times in a row" (xī [[希]] "rarely").
2. Lu# [[屢]] "quite a few times" (ant. hǎn [[罕]] "very seldom") indicates that an event has many precursors similar to it in the past, and the word does not emphasise the high frequency.
3. Qì [[亟]] and pín [[頻]] "very often" (ant.* ǒu [[偶]] "on and off") are probably more intensitive than shuò [[數]].
4. Zòu [[驟]] "repeatedly, within a short period of time" (ant. shū [[疏]] "at long intervals") is more temporary in nature.
5. Cháng [[常]] (ant. xiǎn [[鮮]] "quite rarely, in the natural course of events") refers to fequency as a symptom of something being ordinary and only to be expected.
6. Duō [[多]] (ant. shǎo [[少]] "a few times, few times") is a colourless word indicating that something is of generally frequent occurrence.
