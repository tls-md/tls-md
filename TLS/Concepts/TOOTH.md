# Definition
HARD WHITE THINGS in the MOUTH which are USED FOR BITING AND CHEWING.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Chǐ [[齒]] refers to the visible front teeth, thus when one smiles one shows one's chǐ [[齒]], xiàn chǐ [[見齒]], and only if one were vampire-like would one show any yá [[牙]]. Chǐ [[齒]] does not typically refer to the teeth as weapons of aggressive action. The teeth by which one judges age are always chǐ [[齒]], and the teeth with which one commonly chews tend quite as often to be chǐ [[齒]]. The front teeth that get cold when the lips are gone, are chǐ [[齒]] in classical Chinese, and they are not seen in that common saying as aggressive weapons. The admirable white teeth of a lady are the chǐ [[齒]], only in the case of vampires yá [[牙]]. We have goǔ yá [[狗牙]] but mǎ chí [[馬齒]]. One grinds one's chǐ [[齒]], [[切齒]], not one's yá [[牙]]. The first teeth of a child are never yá [[牙]] and regularly chǐ [[齒]], and similarly for the teeth that an old man loses, when chǐ duò [[齒墮]] "the teeth fall out". Interestingly, the elephant has chǐ [[齒]], never yá [[牙]], presumably because these tusks were taken to be a threat to his own survival, not to man.
2. Yá [[牙]] can occasionally generally refer to teeth, even the exquisite teeth of a woman, but the word typically refers to the large side teeth or fangs of an animal with which it bites, and which are seen as a threat. The threatening teeth of an animal, the teeth with which a rat attacks one's home, are yá [[牙]]. Thus one speaks of the zhuǎ yá [[爪牙]] "the claws and fangs" as metaphors for weapons. Theses are sharp like fangs, and as such they lend themselves to metaphorical use to indicate dented patterns in ornaments.

牙，齒
1. WL follows received opinion in claiming that the front teeth are chi3 齒 whereas the side teeth are ya2 牙: 門牙稱齒，其餘的稱牙.  But as Ko3ng Yi3ngda2 already pointed out, primarily the large agressive teeth like the fangs of a fierce dog are ya2 牙, and even the front teeth of a rat, because of their prominence, are ya2 牙.  Ko3ng's definition, which WL quote, is right: 頷上大齒謂之牙, and the trouble is that WL do not realise that this explanation is quite inconsistent of with the traditional explanation of ya2 牙 as all teeth other than front teeth.
