1. It should be noted that ha2n 寒 is ubiquitous, whereas le3ng 冷 hardly ever occurs, and also lia2ng 涼 is not a current word, and the natural suspicion is that really ha2n 寒 did cover everything from very cold to cool, but in fact, the connotation of ha2n 寒 always seems to have been negative or unpleasant thus excluding the pleasant cool breeze lia2ng fe1ng 涼風 which does get mentioned a few times in the literature.
