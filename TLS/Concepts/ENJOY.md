# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for active enjoyment and delighting in something is lè [[樂]] (ant. bēi [[悲]] "be saddened by"), as in [[與民同樂]] "share one's enjoyings/enjoyments with the people".
2. Xiǎng [[享]] refers to enjoying material benefits or - when applied to gods and spirits - to the enjoyment of sacrifices.
3. Lì [[利]] refers to the use and enjoyment of what one regards as profitable.
4. NB: Hān [[酣]] refers to enjoying (prototypically alcohol) with gusto and enthusiasm, or in a transferred sense enjoying anything else in the way one might enjoy alcohol. The word is marginal to the group.
