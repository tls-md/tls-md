# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for rearing and/or breeding is yù [[育]], which can refer to animals as well as occasionally to humans, and the word belongs to a dignified stylistic layer.
2. Xù [[畜]] refers primarily to the breeding of livestock, but is also used for humans under one's control and below one's status.
3. Yǎng [[養]] refers primarily to the caring for and nourishing of one's parents, children or other humans one feels caring sympathy for and is only occasionally used for non-humans, although it does apply to plants like mulberry trees that need much care.
