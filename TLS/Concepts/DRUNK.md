EBRIETAS, EBRIOSITAS
183. Inter Ebrietatem et ebriositatem. Quod ebrietas aliquando est, ebriositas frequens temulentia vini est. De qua Apostolus ait (I Cor. VI): Neque ebriosi regnum Dei possidebunt. Pulchre autem quidam non ignobilis orator, cum ebrium e [ Al., a] somno describeret excitatum, ait: Neque dormire excitatus, nec vigilare ebrius poterat. Qua sententia 25 expressit [col. 29B] quodammodo nec mortuum eum fuisse, nec vivum.
