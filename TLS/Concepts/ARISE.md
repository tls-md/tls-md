# Definition
The EVENT that something BEGINS to EXIST.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[HIGH-DEGREE/LOW-DEGREE]
[INCHOACTIVE/PERFECTIVE]
1. The most current general word for something arising is probably qǐ [[起]] (ant. zhǐ [[止]] "cease to exist").
[GENERAL]
2. Méng [[萌]] is inchoative and refers to the initial stage of arising.
[INCHOATIVE]
3. Shēng [[生]] (ant. miè [[滅]] "be extinguished (as dinosaurs)") refers to the coming into existence of something which did not previously exist.
[PERFECTIVE]
4. Xīng [[興]] (ant. xí [[息]] "cease to be virulent") and fā [[發]] refer to something moving from an "incubatory" state to a state of manifest "virulence" and full development.
[HIGH-DEGREE], [PERFECTIVE]
5. Chū [[出]] (NB: rù [[入]] cannot be used as an antonym for this meaning.) refers to something that pre-exists emerging or moving from an initial state of hiddenness or non-obviousness to a state of manifest visibility (in analogy with the basic meaning of the word "to come out").
[SPECIFIC]
6. Zuò [[作]] (ant.* xiē [[歇]] "cease to exist, cease to be active, cease to happen") typically refers to something happening or arising for the first time, but the word can also refer to the emergence of persons like sages.
[ORIGINAL], [SPECIFIC]
NB: This group needs to be viewed together with BEGIN, and the line between the two is by no means always clear.

## 
1. Some verbs are inchoative (méng 萌 "begin to arise", qǐ 起 ) others are perfective (chū 出, shēng 生 "come into existence", zuò 作, xīng 興 ).
2. Some verbs describe the emergence or origination of something for the first time (chū 出, méng 萌, shēng 生 ), others describe indifferently the emergence or re-emergence of something (qǐ 起, zuò 作, xīng 興 ).
3. Some verbs refer to the emergence of a concrete event or type of event (qǐ 起, zuò 作, zhì 至, xīng 興, shī 失 ), others refer to the coming into existence of anything abstract or concrete (chū 出, shēng 生 ).
4. Some verbs only refer to the eruption of a process (fā 發 ), the others refer indifferently to processes, events, persons, or things. jiang
