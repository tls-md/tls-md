# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general term for unimportance is qīng [[輕]] (ant. zhòng [[重]] "important").
2. Mò [[末]] (ant. běn [[本]] "basic and important")) refers to something being marginal as opposed to other things that are central or crucial.
3. Xì [[細]] (ant. jù [[巨]] "of tremendous importance") and wēi [[微]] (ant. dà [[大]] "of great importance") refer to things being trifling and without serious impact on a situation.
4. Huǎn [[緩]] (ant. jí [[急]] "urgent and important") refers to something being less important because it is less urgent.
5. Xiǎo [[小]] (ant. dà [[大]] "of great importance") is sometimes used as a colourless term denying the importance of something.
