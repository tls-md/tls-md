# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for the inside of three-dimensional objects as opposed to what is outside them is nèi 內 (ant. wài 外 ), but this word is sometimes used to refer quite generally to the insides territories and the like. There are no degrees of neì 內 : things are either inside or outside.
2. Zhōng 中 (ant. e.g. pàn 畔 "the margins"(!) cf. 江中 versus 江畔 ) typically refers to the centre of a domain and contrasts with the margins or what lies just outside that domain. There are degrees of zhōng 中 : some things may be more central, closer to the core, than others. Note that 中國 does not contrast with 外國 but with ZHOULI 遠國 or occasionally jué guó 絕國. Ancient China did not recognise foreign "states".
3. Lǐ 裡 (ant. biǎo 表 ) is rare and refers in a rather abstract way to what is inward rather than mereley outward.
4. Yāng 央 is only occasionally used to refer to the centre and is most current in the ubiquitous combination 中央 "central; the centre".

Nèi 內 thus refers to the inner versus the outer ( 內臟 not 中臟 ), but note that we do have nèi xīn 內心 "the heart which is inside the body, the inner heart" as well as zhōng xīn 中心 "what is inside the heart, the core of one's heart, one's innermost heart" cf. also 中道 "mid-way". Wài yè 內業 is concerned with what is in one's three-dimenional body, not what is in the yè 業. Zhōng yè 中夜 is the middle of the yè 夜, not the yè 夜 which is in the middle of something.
