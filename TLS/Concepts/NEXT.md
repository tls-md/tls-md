# Definition
IMMEDIATELY BEHIND a SEQUENCE of THINGS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word referring to the next member of a contextually determinate series is cì [[次]] (ant. qián [[前]] "preceding"), and the series can be temporal as well as spatial or indeed abstract.
2. Míng [[明]] (ant. zuó [[昨]] "yester-" and zǎo [[早]] "earlier") refers specifically to the next member of a temporal series of days, months, or years, and míng rì [[明日]] does not mean "tomorrow" but can refer to tomorrow and must always be understood as "the next day, counting from the other contextually definite day". The other contextually definite day can be, but need not be, the "today" of the speech act in which the word occurs.
3. Lái [[來]] (ant. wǎng [[往]] "preceding" and xī [[昔]] ) is a deictic expression and refers specifically to the next member of the temporal series beginning with the present time.
4. Yì [[翌]] is the ancient OBI word for a period of time that is imminent, and the word always retained a literary, elevated, and even antiquated flavour.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
其次 is a common modern word for "next".
