# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard term for a dynasty is dài [[代]], but this term is not used to refer to a person's contemporary dynasty in pre-Han times, and as far as I can see, it is rarely so used in Han times, although there is a clear example of Hàn dài [[漢代]] in HANSHU. Zhōu dài [[周代]] is not in the texts I have surveyed so far, whereas [[周世]] is in SHIJI.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
朝代 is the general modern word for a dynasty.
王朝 focusses on its royal status.
