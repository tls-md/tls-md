# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for a whip is biān [[鞭]], but the word also refers specifically to a leather whip. There is some controversy on whether the biān [[鞭]] was or was not used to drive horses in early times.
2. Cè [[策]] refers specifically to a bamboo whip which remained current in Han times. The cè [[策]] has always been used to drive horses, but seems to have gone out of use in late Han times.
3. Chuí [[箠]] refers to a bamboo whip typically used driving buffalo or sheep along, but the chuí [[箠]] was also used with horses.
NB: Zhàng [[杖]] refers to a cane for beating prisoners.

COMM 21.
鞭，先秦作名詞時指皮革做的驅人毆人工具，亦可指驅馬工具；魏晉之後也可泛指策，表明作驅馬工具的通稱，有口語色彩。
策，先秦以來專用以驅馬的工具，由若干竹條併合編連而成；引申可指駕馭馬的工具，包括韁繩之類。
箠，本指荊楚之類，不限於驅馬，亦可用於毆人和驅趕共他家畜，從漢代開始，箠亦可泛指驅馬工具。
[ 竹＋內 ] ，小車所用驅牲口器具，頂端有 “ 箴 ” ，但整個古代均不見用例，似是 “ 箠 ” 的異體字。
