# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
NB: There is, so far, no sufficient basis to distinguish between the meanings of these words, which are rare in this meaning.
1. Xiè [[謝]] is the standard word to use, but, surprisingly, the word is quite rare.
2. Cí [[辭]] can perhaps be taken to emphasise the explanations made on the occasion of apologising, but examples are too few to be sure.
3. Qǐng [[請]] emphasises, perhaps, the implicit request for the apology to be accepted, but examples are too few to be sure.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
道歉 is the standard word referring to an apology.
致歉 refers in a formal way to the offer of an apology.
賠罪 refers in a formal way to an apology for a serious transgression involving guilt.
