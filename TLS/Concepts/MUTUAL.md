# Definition
INTERACT with and be INTERACTED with.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for mutuality between any number of agents is jiāo [[交]] which can refer to multiple mutual relations entertained or joined into by any given agent.
2. Xiāng [[相]] refers to mutuality but not necessarily reciprocity between two agents and the mutuality does not have to be contemporaneous (NB: the word even more often acts as an object pronouns). Thus X may do something to Y, and Y to Z, and this constellation would allow for the use of xiāng [[相]], as in the phrase xiāng jì [[相繼]] or xiāng suí [[相隨]] "1. follow one another; (but note also the here irrelevant 2. followed him/her/them)". Moreover, xiāng zhù [[相助]] does not imply synchronised or contemporaneous help: X may help Y at one time, and Y may help X at another time, and this collaboration will qualify for xiāng zhù [[相助]].
3. Hù [[互]] refers specifically to reciprocity of interaction between two agents, and the reciprocity of interaction must occur at the same time.
