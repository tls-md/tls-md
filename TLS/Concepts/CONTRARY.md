# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current word for being logically or practically opposed to something else is fǎn 反 (ant. tóng 同 "agree with, go along with").
2. Guāi 乖 refers to any kind of practical contradiction or opposition, also opposition to what is current and acceptable. See WICKED
2. Bèi 悖 (ant. xié 諧 "be in harmony with, be perfectly consistent with") refers quite abstractly to logical incoherence or inconsistency.
3.Hài 害 (ant. yì 益 "further strengthen the point") is a term for logical inconsistency.
4. Xiāng gōng 相攻 and bù xiāng róng 不相容 are technical terms referring to logical incompatibility.
NB: Shuǐ huǒ 水火 is late post-Buddhist and refers vividly to a practical incompatibility.
