# Definition
HAVE OR BE INTENSELY MANY, TYPICALLY DESIRED, THINGS. 
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
ABSTRACT/CONCRETE
ARTIFICIAL/NATURAL
HIGH-DEGREE/LOW-DEGREE
SPECIALISED/UNSPECIFIC
1. The general word for abundance of any kind, man-made or natural, concrete or abstract, is shèng 盛 (ant.*xī 稀 "sparse").
[GENERAL]
2. Fēng 豐 (ant.*qiàn 歉 "poor natural harvest") refers primarily to the natural abundance of some feature or resource, but in elevated archaic discourse the word may also refer to abundance of sacrifice and the like. NB: The rare fēng 丰 was not homophonous in ancient times, and the meaning emphasises beauty as well as abundance.
[NATURAL!]
3. Hòu 厚 (ant. báo 薄 "meagerly supplied with something") primarily refers to man-made or man-caused generous abundance, prototypically in contexts such as hospitality or exchange of presents.
[ARTIFICIAL]
4. Yōu 優 (ant.* liè 劣 "in short supply") refers to special (often commendable) abundance.
[HIGH DEGREE], [ABSTRACT!]
5. Ráng 穰 often refers specifically to abundance of harvest. See HARVEST.
[NATURAL], [SPECIFIC]
5. Pèi rán 沛然 typically refers to the abundance of a flow of things, prototypically rain.
7. Yáng 洋 typically refers specifically to abundance of water over a wide area, but the word is occasionally used in transferred senses to refer to wide-spread abundance. The image of water remains distantly present.
[NATURAL], [SPECIFIC]
8. Wò 渥 (ant. báo 薄 "not very abundant, poorly supplied with liquid or vital energy etc.") typically refers to an abundance of liquids or gases.
[NATURAL], SPECIFIC]
9. Duō 多 is the general word for a large number or a large amount of things. See MANY
## Modern Chinese Criteria
豐富 is the current general modern word for quantitative abundance and qualitative variation, viewed as a positive feature. (ZHANG ZHIYI 1981: 72)
豐厚 typically adds the notion that what is abundant is also important or valuable, and the word normally refers to concrete rather than abstract things, although it may occasionally refer to a range of knowledge etc.. (Cf. ZHANG ZHIYI 1981: 72, LIU SHUXIN 1987: 175)
豐盛 typically focusses on abundance of concrete things like foodstuffs and wine. ZHANG ZHIYI 1981: 72
豐 (cl) is mostly quantitative and has a strong literary flavour. (cf. LIU SHUXIN 1987: 175)
豐滿 focusses positively on full-bodied internal richness of bodies or of fruit and the like, and also to their sufficiency for a given purpose. (Cf. LIU SHUXIN 1987: 178)
飽滿 refers to an inner richness of flowers or fruits, and also more abstractly to an abundance of inner energy e.g. of a person or a tale. (Cf. LIU SHUXIN 1987: 178, and 74)
充分 refers to sufficiency in abstract conditions, reasons and the like. (Cf. LIU SHUXIN 1987: 74)
充沛 refers to natural abundance typically of abstract things like energy, in a highly commendatory way. (Cf. LIU SHUXIN 1987: 74)
充足 refers to abundance as sufficiency for a certain purpose. (Cf. LIU SHUXIN 1987: 74)
雄厚 typically refers to abundance of an abstract kind, as in financial resources or power and the like.

## 
1. The words may refer primarily to man-made abundance (yōu 優, yù 裕 ), or primarily to natural abundance (fēng 豐, yáng 洋 ), or they may indifferently refer to natural or man-made abundance (shèng 盛 ).
>>UNSPECIFIC
2. The words may have strong positive connotations (yōu 優, fēng 豐 ), or they may be basically neutral (yáng 洋, hòu 厚 ).
3. The words may refer to a basically permanent state of abundance (fēng 豐, yáng 洋, yù 裕 ), or to a transitory stage of abundance (shèng 盛 )
4. The words may have strong comparative connotations (yōu 優 ), or they may describe abundance without emphasis on the comparison with less abundant situations (all others).
