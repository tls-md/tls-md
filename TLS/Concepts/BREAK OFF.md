# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general word for breaking anything off is zhé [[折]] and the word refers to the action of breaking something off as such; the action of breaking is not necessarily attributed to a person or animal: the wind may zhé [[折]] something off.
2. Duàn [[斷]] refers to the resultative aspect of the breaking off, typically also cutting off, and the word tended to be metaphorical in early texts, increasingly taking on its concrete meaning at later stages. See CUT.
3. Jué [[絕]] refers - often metaphorically - to causing something to become discontinuous, to be interrupted or broken off.
4. Cuī [[摧]] explicitly refers to human actions of breaking off. (If passivised, these verbs always invite the question of who the agent was.)
5. Cuò [[挫]] refers specifically to blunting the edge of something by breaking off what is sharp, and the word is in any case marginal in this group.
