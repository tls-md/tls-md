# Definition
HABITUALLY GIVE of one's WEALTH to THOSE WHO NEED it.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Probably the most general word for generosity is huì [[惠]] (ant. sè [[嗇]] "stingy, ungenerous"), and this refers to any kind of emotional as well as material munificence by a person of superior status.
2. Hòu [[厚]] (ant. báo [[薄]] "less than ample") refers to generosity of treatment which is not necessarily directed towards inferiors.
3. Shī [[施]] focuses on the very activity involved in generous treatment of others, and the subject of this activitiy is normally a person of superior status.
4. E!n [[恩]] (ant. chóu [[仇]] "hostile attitude") refers primarily to an attitude or disposition (typically on the part of a person of superior status) to be generous.
5. Dé [[德]] and the rarer zé [[澤]] refer to graceful and spiritually inspiring munificence, typically from a person of supremely high status.
6. Kuān [[寬]] and the rarer guǎng [[廣]] can refer to a general disposition towards non-narrow and broadly directed generosity.
7. Zhān [[霑]] refers to receiving the benefits of generosity and is thus marginal in this group, and the word is rare.
NB: Kāng kǎi [[慷慨]] refers to generousity with one's resources, but the usage is first attested in Ming novels.
