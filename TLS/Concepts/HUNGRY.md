# Definition
NEED FOOD FOR ONESELF NOW.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most common current and general word for insufficiency of food supplies is probably jī 飢 (ant. bǎo 飽 "have eaten enough"), and this word refers to any such insufficiency, temporary or lasting, serious or minor. Presumably, the word can also refer to insufficiency of food among animals.
2. È 餓 refers to famine as a serious condition threatening the lives of the persons involved.
3. Jǐn 殣 refers to serious famine often resulting in death.
4. Jī 饑 (NOT ANCIENTLY HOMOPHONOUS WITH 飢 in ancient Chinese), and the rarer jín 饉 as well as the very rare qiàn 歉 refer to insufficiency of food as a result of bad harvest.
5. Něi 餒 refers to the state of being hungry in an individual, and at a certain time.

Results: 1. the distinction between 飢 and 餓 is not one between a literary and a colloquial word.
2. There is a clear difference in degree between the two words.
3. Beginning from Han times the distinction between the two words is gradually neutralised, but a nuance of difference in degree remains.

This is a very detailed article which deserves careful close consideration.
