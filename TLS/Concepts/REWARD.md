## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for rewarding is shǎng [[賞]] (ant. fá [[罰]] "punish" and zhū [[誅]] "punish").
2. Láo [[勞]] (ant. chéng [[懲]] "punish") focusses on the contribution by those who are being rewarded.
3. Kào [[犒]] focusses on the festive character of the ceremony accompanying or constituting the reward.
4. Bào [[報]] construes the reward as being an interaction between equals.
5. Cí [[賜]] refers to a present to an inferior in recognition of the latter's worth. For most examples see GIVE.
NB: The meaning of shǎng [[賞]] "give as a present" is post-Buddhist.

賜，賞
1. WL maintains that ci4 賜 simply means to give to an inferior 只表明為上之施予，不問有功無功. This is misleading, since ci4 賜 is often explicitly in recognition of personal moral merit, worth and desert, whereas sha3ng 賞 is directed at specific meritorious achievement.
HF 14.07:11; jiaoshi  224; jishi 249; jiaozhu 135; shiping 490
使民以功賞 they bring it about that people are rewarded for their achievements
   而不以仁義賜； but do not receive gratuitous gifts for moral excellence;
Occasionally, ci4 賜 is also in recognition of a meritorious action:
HF 30.32:01; jishi 551; jiaozhu 322; shiping 955
“有能徙此南門之外者， 毣s for the person who is able to shunt this thing outside the South Gate
10賜之上田、上宅。”
Rewards to others than the king's public servants are standardly called ci4 賜:
HF 32.10:01, jiaoshi 480; jishi 625; jiaozhu 370; shiping 1084 
宋王與齊仇也， The King of So4ng was on enemy terms with Q
築武宮。 and he built a military academy.
謳癸倡， Singer Gu led the singing
行者止觀， so that passers-by stopped to look
5築者不倦。 and the builders were untiring.
王聞， When the King heard about this 
召而賜之。 he summoned the man and gave him presents.
In fact, even a senior minister could be rewarded in terms of ci4 賜 as reported by a senior minister who was given a fine vehicle:
HF 33.09:02; jiaoshi 527; jishi 679; shiping 1179; jiaozhu 411
曰： He said:
“君謀欲伐中山，   "The ruler is making plans and wants to launch a formal attack on Zho1ngsha1n.
10臣薦翟角 I have recommended D Jia3o
   而謀得果； and the plan achieved the desired result;
且伐之， when we were about to launch our formal attack
臣薦樂羊而中山拔； I recommended Yue4ya2ng and Zho1ngsha1n was taken.
得中山， when we had won Zho1ngsha1n
憂欲治之， we were worried and wanted to govern the place properly
15臣薦李克而中山治： so I recommended L Ke4, and Zho1ngsha1n was well-govverned.
是以君賜此車。” That is why the ruler has conferred on me this vehicle."

Rewards and gifts are both regularly signs of appreciation, although there is the gratuitous gift of kindness: 慈惠之賜:
HF 45.05:10; jiaoshi 108; jishi 939; jiaozhu 615; shiping 1564; 
賞賜， Rewards and presents
所以為重也； are ways to show one掇 deep regard for someone.
