# Definition
APPEARANCE of the PLACE something is in, as PERCEIVED by the EYES, DISREGARDING the SUBJECTIVITY of the APPEARANCE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general word describing the physical shape of something is xíng [[形]].
2. Mào [[貌]] and the much rarer and more abstract biǎo [[表]] are terms referring to mere external physical outline as opposed to inner reality.
3. Zhuàng [[狀]] is the dynamic physical manifestation of something.
4. Guān [[觀]] is the visual aspect of something, including its coloration.
5. Xiàng [[相]] is the significant external form (including coloration) as indicative of what is behind it.
6. Xiàng [[象]] "abstract pattern made by things" is both aesthetic and metaphysical in force and construes appearance as something symbolic of and structurally similar to an underlying reality.
7. Wén [[文]] refers to dignified, fine pattern a shape makes.
