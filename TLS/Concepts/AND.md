# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[VERBAL-SCOPE/NOMINAL-SCOPE]
[PREDICATE-SCOPE/SENTENCE-SCOPE/SUBJECT-SCOPE]
1. Yǔ 與 "and" is the general all-purpose coordinating particle between NPs which, in ZUO, is equally common in subject and object position, and which coordinates both with concrete and abstract items, often topics, sometimes even pivots.
[NOMINAL-SCOPE]
2. Jí 及 "and" is between NPs, and at least in ZUO the conjunction is predominantly between concrete (also multiple) objects and occasionally between non-abstract subjects.
[NOMINAL-SCOPE]
3. E@r 而 is between VPs or sentences (and can occasionally occur between subject/topic nouns and the predicate in subordinate sentences, but in usage it does not belong into the present synonym group).
[SENTENCE-SCOPE], [VERBAL SCOPE]
4. Yǐ 以 is normally between a non-main and a main VP but may occasionally be purely coordinating and equivalent to ér 而.
[VERBAL-SCOPE]
5. Jì 既... ér 而 is between coordinates and equally weighted VPs.
[VERBAL-SCOPE]
6. Qiě 且 is between coordinate VPs, but the word also functions as a sentence connective.
[VERBAL-SCOPE], [SENTENCE-SCOPE]
