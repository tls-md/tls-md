ABSCONSUM, ABSCONDITUM, OCCULTUM, ARCANUM
9. Inter Absconditum et absconsum. Absconsum est cujuslibet arte celatum, absconditum vero naturaliter abditum. Conditum est enim, non consum. Inde et consuere dicitur, quando rupta [ Al., erupta] atque aperta quaeque texuntur [ Al., trahuntur]. Porro occultum [ Al., occultatum] ab occulendo, id est, claudendo, dictum. Arcanum vero ab arca vel ab arcendo, eo quod ab eo omnes arceantur, id est, prohibeantur. [col. 11B] Inde et arces dicuntur, a quibus arceantur hostes. Inde et arca, eo quod arceat furem. Inde et arcus, eo quod arceat adversarium.
