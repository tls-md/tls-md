# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
甲乙丙 are currently used as variables ranging over persons in legal texts, and also in mathematical texts like JIUZHANG. The analysis of the use of variables in mathematical texts is obviously of great importance. An abstract term for a variable does not exist in Chinese, and neither does it in Greek, where Aristotle made extensive and highly systematic use of variables which stand for predicates.
