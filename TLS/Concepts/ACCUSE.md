## 
1. The words in this group differ in the degree to which they imply formal legal proceedings (hé 劾 ) or simply consist in the attribution of criminal responsibility (zèn 譖, zé 責, zuì 罪 ).
2. The words differ in the seriousness of the charges implied, some words implying that the charge is comparatively serious (qiǎn 譴, hé 劾, zé 責 ), others being applied indiscriminately to more or less serious charges (zuì 罪, sù 訴, kòng 控 ).
3. The words differ in the justice of the charges brought, some implying that the charge is definitely just (zé 責, tán 彈 ), others being indifferent to the justice of the charge (zuì 罪, kòng 控, sù 訴 ), and others still definitely implying that the charges are false (wū 誣, zèn 譖, chǎn 諂 ).
4. The words differ as to whether the charge is brought against a person who must be present (zé 責 ), against a person who may or may not be present (zuì 罪, sù 訴, kòng 控, wū 誣 ), or against a person who is definitely absent (zèn 譖 ).
5. The words differ as to whether the person making the accusation normally has higher status than the accused (zhé 謫, zuì 罪 ), or whether 厎 he words are indifferent to the status of the accused versus the accuser.
GOVERNMENT AND LAW 36. 訴訟。
訴，將自己所受的不平之事告訴司法部門，最早出現於漢代。
訟，對仲裁人告訴并爭辯彼此的是非曲直。
告，主動告訴他人的犯罪言行，春秋戰國時已見。
發，將他人隱蔽的犯罪言行告訴有關部門。
