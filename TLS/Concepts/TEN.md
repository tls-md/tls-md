1. The standard word for "ten" is shí [[十]].
2. In the meaning "ten parts" both shí [[十]] and shí [[什]] are used.
NB: In front of bèi [[倍]] one would expect shí [[十]], but shí bèi [[什倍]] is common and idiomatic.

1. Note that in the common idiom shi2 be4i 什倍 the graph shi2 什 is current, and this is inconsistent with the account in WL 15.
2. WL 15 claims that shi2 什 is always a collective noun, but the word is common as a transitive verb as well as an adnoun.
