# Definition
WHAT CAN be HEARD.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The dominant word for any sound produced by any creature or instrument is shēng [[聲]] and the word can come to refer specifically to the sound produced by the human voice (see VOICE), hence the word can also refer to a song with a melody and also to the tones as making up a melody. See SONG.
2. Yīn [[音]] is much narrower in application, and more elevated in style, and the word typically applies to sound shaped into music or the like and often viewed as an aesthetic object. [[聲成文謂之音]]。 "When sound makes a pattern it becomes yīn", true enough, but it does remain shēng [[聲]] also.
3. Xiāo [[囂]] and xuān [[喧]] refer primarily to the din of human voices, but these words do have regular extended uses where they refer to any noisy or irritating sound.
4. Xiǎng [[響]], which primarily means "echo", often comes to refer to any sound without any connotations concerning the irritating nature of the sound.

聲，音
1. WL takes she1ng 聲 to refer to the sound produced by man singing, and yi1n 音 the sound of musical instruments.  But LY's famous 弦歌之聲 makes it clear that things are not this easy.  And HF 鼓鐸之聲 "sound of drums and hand-bells" makes it plain that it is plain wrong. Moreoever, we have
HF 28.02:07 不聽鐘石之聲 "he did not listen to the sound of bells and musical stone instruments".
Thus the traditional rationalisation is highly problematic.
