1. WL claims that pi2 皮 refers to fur with hair on, but this is not quite right:
ZUO Xi 14.4.2  (646 B.C.); Ya2ng Bo2ju4n 348;  Wa2ng Sho3uqia1n et al. 246;  tr. Legge 162
虢射曰： Guo2 She4 said,
「皮之不存， "When the skin has been lost,
毛將安傅？」 where can you place the hair?"
The fact is that pi2 皮 refers to the kind of skin on which fur naturally grows.  That is quite a different matter.  Pi2 ma2o 皮 is there not necessarily a synonym compound:
ZHUANG 28.1.4 Guo Qingfan 966; Wang Shumin 1118; Fang Yong 778; Chen Guying 744
冬日衣皮毛， In wintertime I wear skins and furs; 

The opposition is explained again on p. 1626 in a different way!!!
