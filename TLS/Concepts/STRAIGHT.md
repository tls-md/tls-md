## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for something concrete or abstract being straight in any abstract or concrete way is zhí 直 (ant. wān 彎 "bent")
2. Zhèng 正 (ant. qǔ 曲 "bent") refers to straightness as the desirable state of something.
3. Duān 端 (ant. xié 斜 "slanted") and zhēn 貞 (ant. xié 邪 "morally warped") refer to straightness and non-crookedness, often as a property of abstract things.
4. Gěng 鯁 (ant. qū 屈 "bent") is a rare word referring to straightness in speech or straightness in small objects.
