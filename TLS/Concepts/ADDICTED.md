酗，酖
1. WL takes xu4 酗 to refer to actual excessive use of wine, da1n 酖 only to an excessive desire for wine.  But given the scarcity of examples there is no way of being sure.  
One feels that underdocumented distinctions should be listed differently or separately from distinctions that can be seen to be operative in the texts.
