# Definition
LEAVE QUICKLY AND SECRETLY, FEARING DANGER.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for illicit disappearance from where one has some obligation to remain is zǒu [[走]].
2. Táo [[逃]] refers to an attempted or successful escape to a place, or from any difficult predicament (for which see AVOID), occasionally also from a person or group of persons. Thus to [[逃]] a state is to flee TO a state, to [[逃]] a predicament is to flee FROM a predicament, and to [[逃]] a person is to flee FROM that person.
3. Bèi [[北]] is to flee during a battle engagement.
4. Bēn [[奔]] is refers to absconding from a place at high speed.
5. Dùn [[遁]] is to get away by simply going into hiding rather than by seeking refuge in a certain alternative place.
6. Wáng [[亡]] and the much rarer sàng [[喪]] often refers to a dignified almost public way of leaving one place for another, especially to going into exile in order to escape danger.
7. Yì [[逸]] / [[佚]] is to seek and find freedom through fleeing from an oppressive situation.
8. Cuàn [[竄]] is primarily to sneak away, availing oneself of a narrow "window of opportunity", and going into hiding after the flight.
NB: There is a striking number of binomes expressing flight. These need to be analysed in detail to determine their semantic nuances.
