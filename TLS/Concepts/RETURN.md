# Definition
TRAVEL to a PLACE FROM which one COMES.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard general word for returning to where one belongs is guī1 [[歸]] (zhī [[之]] "go to").
2. Fǎn [[反]] / [[返]] (ant. wǎng [[往]] "set out for") is to get back to where one came from, and the focus is on whereto one returns. [[及反]] is "when he had got back", [[未反]] is "before he had god back". [[反哭]] is wailing upon one's return, not while returning.
3. Huán [[還]] (ant. wǎng [[往]] "set out for") typically refers to turning round and preparing to retrace one's steps or one's route, very often after a military or civil engagement, successful or unseccessful, and the focus is on wherefrom one returns. [[還]] as a subordinate sentence is "when he was on his way back". See TURN ROUND
4. Fù [[復]] (ant. lí [[離]] "quit") is sometimes used for returning to or regaining a position.

還，返
1. WL explains  that hua2n 　“還”重在表示沿著去路回來；　“返”側重轉身往回來。In fact the situation is quite the opposite.  Hua2n 還 is mostly inchoative and often refers to the ongoing process, and the refers to the action of turning back so as to return, and only in a minority of cases is the word used generally to refer to the completed action of returning.  Fa3n 返, on the other hand, is clearly perfective and refers to getting back to where one came from.
