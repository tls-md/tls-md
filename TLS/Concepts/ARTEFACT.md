# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[BASIC/MARGINAL]
NB: This synonym group is needed for the taxonomy of the system and is not suggested by any current Chinese usage.
1. The philosophically important general term for something man-made and in this sense artificial is wěi 偽.
[MARGINAL]
2. Yì 藝 is sometimes used to refer to an artefact, perhaps insofar as this is the result of special skill.
[MARGINAL]
