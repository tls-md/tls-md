# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Classical Chinese had several common copulas at an early stage: wéi [[維]] / [[唯]] / [[惟]] (ant. fēi [[非]] "is not") was common in SHI and SHU, but discontinued later.
2. The final particle yě [[也]] is interpreted by some as a sentence-final copula, but it is properly regarded as a sentential particle marking non-narrative modes of predication.
3. The standard copula in Warring States Chinese is wéi [[為]], which tends to have human subjects and is by no means as common in Chinese as the copula is in Western languages.
4. Yuē [[曰]] is current as a copula in listings of items and the like.
5. Yún [[云]] is a rare archaising copula in ZUO.
6. Zé [[則]] is copula-like after contrastive subjects.
7. Nǎi [[乃]] is copula-like and contrastive and stresses that the subject is none other than the predicate.
8. Dāng [[當]] "act as, fulfill the function of" is copula-like, but there is only a slight degree of grammaticalisation in the direction of a copula.
9. Wèi [[謂]] "be counted as, count as" sometimes moves in the direction of copula-like uses.
10. Shì [[是]] is a resumptive demonstrative pronoun which on very rare occasions can come to function very much as a copula.
11. Zhòng [[中]] has some copula-like uses in GUAN, when the word means "amount to, cost" and sometimes even stands before ordinary nominal predicates.
12. Yǐ [[以]] "as a SUBJECT" functions quite regularly as a subordinate copula in classical Chinese.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
是 is the standard modern copula.
為 is literary in flavour.
乃 (lit) is classical.
系 is an old-fashioned or obsolescent copula.
則 has copula usages
