# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general term for all sorts of troubled states of mind, as well as reasons for such states of mind, is yōu [[憂]] (ant. xǐ [[喜]] "be well pleased" and lè [[樂]] "feel deep joy"), and this word may freely refer to troublesome matters of the present or of the future, and the word typiccally refers to a termporary state of hightened awareness of what is troublesome and concern about what should be done about it.
2. Lu �[[慮]] (ant. wàng [[忘]] "refuse to think about, ignore") refers to active reflection upon what one is worried about.
3. Fán [[煩]] (ant. jìng [[靜]] "feel completely at peace") refers to a passive reaction of unsettled anxiousness about something other than oneself.
4. Zào [[躁]] (ant. dìng [[定]] "be well-settled and unruffled") refers to the state of being flustered, restless and upset by worries.
5. Jí [[急]] (ant. ān [[安]] "feel comfortable") refers to urgent and particularly acute temporary worries about something present or immediately imminent.
6. Jí [[疾]] (ant. níng [[寧]] "feel at peace") refers to intense and profound worries about something present (and these worries may or may not be lasting).
7. Huàn [[患]] (ant. lè [[樂]] "feel deeply happy with") refers to intense worry or concern about the possible future effects of something or the possibility of events in the future.
8. Āi [[哀]] (ant. lè [[樂]] "feel perfectly happy with"), when it refers to intense worry rather than grief, connotes despondency and hopelessness and not just worry over possibilities.
9. Chóu [[愁]] (ant. yuè [[說]]／[[悅]] "feel pleased"), and the rarer poetic sāo [[騷]], qiǎo [[悄]], tì [[惕]] refer to various shades and degrees of poetically conceived anxiousness.
10. Shì [[事]] (ant. zhì [[治]] "well-ordered situation") can refer to the kinds of matters or affairs that cause one to be anxious or worried.
