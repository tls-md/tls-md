# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general word for awe-inspiring greatness and significance is wěi [[偉]] (ant. [[眇]] / [[渺]] "trifling").
2. Dà [[大]] (ant. xiǎo [[小]] "insignificant") is often used to refer to generally recognised awe-inspiring status (for example of a king etc) rather than mere size.
3. Hóng [[弘]] and jù [[巨]] (ant. xì [[細]] ) are stylistically marked strong words to use for the greatness of something. See IMPORTANT
4. Hóng [[鴻]] refers to greatness as essentially linked to immense size.
5 Kǒng [[孔]] is an archaic word referring to immensity, numerousness as well as remarkable intensity of something.
