逼，迫
1. WL claims that the difference is between bi1 逼 indirect pressure and p4o 迫 direct pressure.  This comes close, but bi1 逼 is often very direct pressure, and the main difference is in po4 迫 referring to coercion involving threats, and is mostly used in the passive to refer to someone being exposed to such undue coercion, whereas bi1 逼 refers to more emotional pressure, normally without that element straightforward coercion, and the word is usually used as a transitive verb.
