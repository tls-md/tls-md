# Definition
WRITE so as to TRANSMIT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general word for noting something down so as to prevent it from being forgotten is jì [[記]].
2. Zhì [[志]] as well as the late and rare lù [[錄]] refer to making a record of something for the inspiration of others.
3. Zǎi [[載]] is a rare word and refers to making a due formal, sometimes even ritual record of something in the proper literary place.
4. Jǔ [[舉]] refers to not omitting something from the record and bringing it up there as one should.
5. Jì [[紀]] is sometimes used interchangeably with jì [[記]], but the specific force of jì [[紀]] is to focus not just on recording but on the compilation and redaction of a comprehensive record.

記，志，載
1. Of these za3i 載 is so rare in pre-Buddhist times that we have only a slim basis to judge its meaning. (And incidentally, za4i 載 is an unusually slippery and diffuse word to intepret in ancient literature. But that is a separate question which does not really belong here.)
