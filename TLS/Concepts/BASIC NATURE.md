2. Qíng [[情]] (ant. wěi [[偽]] "artificical acquired character") refers to the basic nature of a thing as forming a pattern of reaction to other things.
3. Xīn [[心]] refers specifically to psychological aspects of animate nature.
4. Tiān [[天]] refers specifically to the non-man-made aspect of the nature of things.
5. Zī [[資]] refers to human nature as an endowment and an asset given to man by nature.
6. Wéi rén [[為人]] and wéi wù [[為物]] the possibly conditioned and hardly alterable basic constitutive nature of thing.

ingenium focusses that part of natura which concerns particularly the faculties of the mind.
indoles refers to human disposition in so far as it constitutes only the beginning of an individuality which can devekop from it, and is susceptible to improvement.
