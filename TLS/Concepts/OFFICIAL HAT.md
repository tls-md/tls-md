## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Miǎn [[冕]] refers specifically to the ceremonial hat worn by the emperor or the highest officials on the occasion of sacrifices, feasts and other special occasions. The kinds of miǎn [[冕]] worn were distinguished by rank.
2. Biàn [[弁]] refers to the ceremonial hats worn as signs of their dignity, on lesser occasions, by high officials including the emperor himself, and often this is specified as a pí biàn [[皮弁]].
3. Gǔn [[袞]] refers to the special official hat worn by the emperor, and the word is quite rare. In fact the word comes close to the meaning of "crown", except that no metal was involved.
