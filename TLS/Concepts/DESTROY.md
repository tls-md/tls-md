亡，滅
1. WL claims that wa2ng 亡 cannot be used as a transitive verb.  In fact, however, wa2ng 亡 is common as a causative verb "cause to be ruined". Wa2ng 亡 is quite commnon as a transitive vrb, but the same time it remains remarkable that suo3 wa2ng 所亡 "what is lost" does not seem to mean "what is destroyed", neither does wa2ng zhi1 亡之 come to mean "destroyed it".
