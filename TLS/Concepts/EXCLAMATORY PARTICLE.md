# Definition
PARTICLE USED FOR EMPHASISING. [NOTE THAT THE GRAMMATICAL PARTICLES HAVE NOT BEEN FOCUSSED SO FAR IN THE SYSTEM AND NO SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS HAS BEEN APPLIED SO FAR.]
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general exclamatory particle is zāi 哉, and this word expresses the speaker's intensely held emphatic attitude towards what he says.
2. Hū 乎 typically invites a commonality of intensely held emphatic attitude between speaker and listener and is thus semantically related to final fú 夫 meaning n'est ce pas in that these particles, although express quite different nuances of meaning, do contain the same element of communicative appeal to audience rather than straight expressiveness as such.
3. Xī 嘻 "Ha!" expresses surprise.
