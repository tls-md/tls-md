# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for a bridge is liáng [[梁]], and this word refers to a bridge which is large enough for a cart or carriage to pass.
2. Qiáo [[橋]] begins to be used for a very substantial bridge in Han times and refers then to a major bridge on which several carts might even cross from different directions at the same time. The word seems to be of colloquial origin, and referred originally to the "bridge" or crosspiece across a well.
3. Gāng [[杠]] is a small, usually short bridge, sometimes with stone frame and one wooden planks to walk on.

橋，梁
1. While it is true that qia2o 橋 is not commonly used before Han times to refer to a bridge independently, its common use in place names does seem to indicate clearly that the word did mean bridge even in early times described in ZUO. HEGUAN does have 橋梁. The famous granary in ZUO at Ju4qia2o 句橋, I imagine, was not named after a large beam over a well, but rather a bridge.
