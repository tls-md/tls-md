# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[ABSTRACT/CONCRETE]
[+FIG/LITERAL]
1. The general word for tying things together into a bundle is shù 束 (ant. jiě 解 "untie"), and the word generally refers to the tying of things together in a bundle-like manner and not to the tying up of humans.
[CONCRETE]
2. Fú 縛 (ant. jiě 解 "untie") is primarily to tie up a person with a rope to restrict his freedom of movement, but ther word can also, by extension, be used to refer to tying up things.
[CONCRETE]
3. Guàn 貫 is to string things together as in a string of cash in the traditional Chinese style, but the word is also used in transferred senses.
[SPECIFIC], [+FIG]
4. Wéi 維 refers - often in an abstract way - to the tying together or connecting of things.
[ABSTRACT!]
There is a large number or more or less rare words which refer in hardly distinguishable ways to the tying together of things.

束，申
1. She1n 申 is too rare in this meaning to suffer analysis, and the word does seem to be metaphorical in sense in the difficult example presented.
