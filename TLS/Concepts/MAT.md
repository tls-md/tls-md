# Definition
A BLANKET FOR PUTTING ON the FLOOR.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The more common word xí 席 refers to a mat used for sitting on, typically in ceremonial contexts. Bì xí 避席 is to leave this kind of sitting mat in order to make a formal pronouncement. A xí 席 may also be placed on a bed.
2. Yán 筵 is specifically the larger carpet-like mat put on the floor on which the xí 席 is placed in turn, but this distinction came to be blurred. The word is very regularly associated with the jī 几 "low table" which one suspects were placed on the yán 筵 alongside with the xí 席 "sitting mat".
3. Rù 褥 refers to a mattress-like padded mat used for sleeping on.

席，筵
1. WL omits the main difference between these two which is that the xi2 席 is for a person to sit on, whereas the ya2n 筵 is not only for the xi2 席 to be placed on, but for the ji1 几 "low table" to be placed together with it.  The association of the ya2n 筵 with the xi2 席 is ubiquitous.
