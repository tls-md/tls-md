# Definition
LACK ALL POSSIBLE THINGS INSIDE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most geneal word is xū [[虛]] (ant. shí [[實]] "substantial and full") which can refer both to physical emptiness of a space and to abstract emptiness or tenuousness as a philosophical concept.
2. Kōng [[空]] (ant. mǎn [[滿]] "filled up") generally refers to literal emptiness of a container, but used adjectivally the word also has abstract uses as in kōng yán [[空言]] "empty words, abstract insubstantial discourse".
3. Wú [[無]] (ant. yǒu [[有]] "existence") refers to the philosophical abstract construct of "nothingness, emptiness".
4. Kuò [[廓]] and kuàng [[曠]] emphasise the expansiveness of the empty space.
