1. The ancient standard word for fullness of any kind is yíng 盈.
2. Mǎn 滿 became current in late Warring States times only, and the word is semantically hard to distinguish from yíng 盈.
3. Chōng 充 refers to complete fullness, fullness to the brim, typically as something desirable or satisfactory.
4. Shí 實 can refer to something being full of solid substance, and thus by extension not tenuous or unimportant.
