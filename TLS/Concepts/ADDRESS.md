## Old Chinese Criteria
[ASCENDING/HORIZONTAL/DESCENDING]
[FORMAL/INFORMAL]
[IMPORTANT/INSIGNIFICANT]
[PRESCRIBED/SPONTANEOUS]
[PRIVATE/PUBLIC]
1. Duì [[對]] "respond" (opp. wèn [[問]] "ask") refers to responses to superiors (See REPLY) whereas wèi [[謂]] often addresses inferiors. Yán [[言]] is neutral in this respect.
[ASCENDING], [FORMAL], [PRESCRIBED]
2. Wèi [[謂]] is a common word referrring to any form of addressing (often of inferiors) for which the subject has taken an independent initiative.
[DESCENDING!], [SPONTANEOUS]
3. Yán [[言]] (ant. mò [[默]] "fail to speak up, remain silent") typically involves addressing someone with a formal (often public and political) suggestion, taking the initiative to speak up.
[FORMAL], [PUBLIC!], [SPONTANEOUS]
4. Gào [[告]] is typically to address an individual or a group in a formal way or in an important matter, and the content of the address is most often information, but there are also often questions or suggestions involved, when these questions and suggestions are passed on as a message from someone else than the speaker himself.
[FORMAL], [IMPORTANT], [SPONTANEOUS]

謂，曰
1. WL claims that we4i 謂 does not introduce direct speech by itself and is always followed by yue1 曰 when introducing speech.  In fact, the situation is much more complicated, and we4i 謂 does introduce direct speech by itself without yue1 曰 many times even in LY, the special nuance being brought out in the translations below:
子謂子賤〔KZJY adds: 曰〕:君子哉若人!魯無君子者,斯焉取斯?
"The Master said of Zjia4n: 'What a gentleman, this kind of person! If there were no gentlemen in Lu3, how could he have acquired his qualities?" LY 5.3
One sees easily why the Jia1yu3 家語 added the yue1 曰: "What a gentleman, this kind of person" is unmistakably direct speech in the classical Chinese as in English.  And the fact is there is no yue1 曰 in the LY text. Neither is there in the following:
子謂公冶長可妻也。雖在縲絏之中,非其罪也。以其子妻之。
"The Master said about Go1ngye3 Cha2ng: 'He is a suitable person to give someone to in marriage.  Although he is in fetters, it is not his crime.' He married him off to his daughter." LY 5.1
The Lu4nhe2ng 論衡 does not recognise this construction and quotes our passage with yue1 曰 for we4i 謂 which certainly makes for easier reading.
子謂南容邦有道不廢。邦無道免於刑戮。以其兄之子妻之。
"The Master said about Na2n Ro2ng: 'When the Way prevailed in the state he was not cast aside.  When the Way did not prevail in the state he avoided punishment and execution.' And he gave him his elder brother's daughter in marriage." LY 5.2
子謂子產有君子之道四焉:其行己也恭,其事上也敬,其養民也惠,其使民也義。
"The Master said about Zcha3n: 'He has four Ways of the gentleman: in his actions he is diligent; in his service for superiors he is respectful; in caring for the people he is generous; in deploying the people he is just." LY 18.8
One can see why one would want to avoid a form like z we4i Zcha3n yue1 子謂子產曰 to mean "The Master commented on Zcha3n saying:'...'". This is simply because such a form would be obviously bound to be misunderstood to mean "Confucius told Zcha3n: '...'".
子謂衛公子荊善居室。始有曰:苟合矣。少有曰:苟完矣。富有曰:苟美矣。
"The Master said about Prince Jng: 'He was good at living in houses.  When he first had one he said: "It will do for the time being." When he had a somewhat larger one he said: "It has everything for the time being." When he had a sumptuous place he said: "It is beautiful for the time being."'" LY 13.8. Compare also LY 5.16 and 18.8 for the same construction.
Couvreur p. 213 indulges in a beautifully complex pattern of direct speech within indirect speech in his Latin paraphrase: "Magister aiebat Wei regni magnum praefectum Koung Tzeu king bene contentum esse domo sua;quum doeperit possidere aliquantulum, dixisse, 'Paululum comparavi;' quum aliquantulam copiam habuerit, dixisse, 'Fere completa est [opulentia mea];' quum abunde habuerit, dixisse, 'Fere splendidum est'."  The question is precisely whether this way of construing the Chinese does or does not have any soundbasis in classical Chinese grammar. The answer is that traditional Chinese commentators have been consistently indifferent to our distinction.33  D.C. Lau 1983, p. 123 renders this indifference towards the problem of direct/indirect speech well in his translation, but he does not maintain that studied indifference in the punctuation of the Chinese text.
