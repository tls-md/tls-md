# Definition
THEREUPON AND NOT BEFORE that.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Rán hòu [[然後]] and ér hòu [[而後]] typically focus on the logical or causal need of A happening (before B can happen), i.e. the new element tends to be A, and A is considered as a GENERAL logical or causal precondition for B.
2. Fāng [[方]] means "not before then, only then", and the focus is simply on the concrete temporal sequence of events in which A precedes B.
3. Nǎi [[乃]] is specifically "then and only then" and focusses on the concrete event B happening happening at last (after A).
