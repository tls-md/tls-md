# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for using up anything material or immaterial is jìn 盡.
2. Jié 竭 (ant. yíng 盈 "leave plenty of something") typically refers to the using up of what one has in one, or what one owns.
3. Xī 悉 refers to using up all that is under one's control or command.
4. Qióng 窮 and dān 殫 focusses on the result of exhausting resources as being the absence of these resources.
NB: Fá 乏 (ant. zú 足 "leave a sufficient supply of") refers to the state of something being almost completely used up, and the word is thus marginal in the group.
