# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The dominant word for the sea is hǎi 海.
2. Míng 冥 / 溟 are probably wrongly interpreted as referring to the sea, but since this misapprehension has become fairly common the meaning "sea" must be registered for the word in later times.
3. Xiè 澥 is a rare word referring to a gulf.
NB: Yáng 洋 refers to the vast ocean, but the word first became current in Song times.
