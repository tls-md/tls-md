# Definition
INTENSELY POSSIBLE AND EXPECTED to be TRUE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general current word for probability is the particle gài [[蓋]]／[[盍]] (ant.* bì [[必]] "certainly, undoubtedly"), which emphasises that a statement is not based on direct objective evidence.
2. Qí [[其]] indicates that a statement must be true, for everything one knows, but could conceivably be false.
3. The final particle yún [[云]] is used in historical sources to indicate that something is not based on direct historical evidence but on hearsay or secondary sources only.
4. Yì [[意]] and yì zh3ě [[意者]] emphasise that a statement is a mere matter of subjective surmising.
5. Kě [[可]] (ant. bì [[必]] "certainly, undoubtedly") is occasionally used to refer to something being only possibly, not necessarily, the case.
6. Hào [[好]] refers to a proneness to do something, typically something one is not supposed to be prone to do.
7. Shàn [[善]] refers generally to any proneness or tendency to do something.
