# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard word for communal clamouring by a group, often expressive of dissatisfaction, is huá 嘩 / 譁.
2. Xiāo 囂 emphasises the loudness of the communal din, and the word is current as a reduplicated binome.
3. Huān 讙 is an onomatopoetic word suggesting gleeful clamour and jubilation.
4. Zào 噪 refers to noisiness of a flock of birds or a crowd, and written with the speech radical 譟 currently refers to the clamour of a crowd.
