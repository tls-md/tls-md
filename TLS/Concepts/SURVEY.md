觀，覽，望
1. WL finds that the focus of gua1n 觀 is on the subjective attention and la3n 覽 on comprehensiveness of coverage.  In fact the main difference is that la3n 覽 is typically downwards from a higher perspective, and that la3n 覽 clearly tends to emphasise an aesthetic dimension of gaining a full view of something whereas gua1n 觀 typically emphasises detailed information gained through observation.
2. WL sees wa4ng 望 as referring to viewing something from a distance.  This is true enough, but it is my impression that an important general nuance of the word is complementary to la3n 覽 "gaze down all over", so that wa4ng 望 often comes to mean "look up to from afar", although there are generalised uses where wa4ng 望 refers to looking down into the distance e.g. from a mountain, and at sheep, with no nuances of admiration whatsoever.
3. Note incidentally that la3n 覽 is extremely common from Han times in the meaning "to read with proper appreciation" which is lacking in WL.
