# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word for making an approximate extimate or guess is chuǎi [[揣]].
2. Cè [[測]] can be a well-founded assessment in some contexts, but the word has a well-established lexicalised function where it means generally "to guess".
3. Yì [[意]] is the subjective and arbitrary formation of an opinion, and the word has a somewhat "philosophical" flavour.
4. Shè [[射]] is guessing as part of a game of guessing and cannot be used for "to guess" in any other contexts.
5. Cǔn [[忖]] is a poetic word for assessing or estimating something that is not verifiable.
6. Duó [[度]] refers to a subjective assessment or estimation of something.
7. Kuí [[揆]] emphasises the conjectural element in guessing or estimating something.
8. Zhòng [[中]] and zhǔn [[准]] refer to getting things right when estimating or guessing.
