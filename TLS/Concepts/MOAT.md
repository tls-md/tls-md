# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria

2. Gōu [[溝]] often refers to any kind of canal, but can be used in particular for defensive canals, especially those not built in conjunction with city walls.

ARCHITECTURE 2. 我國從上古至宋代的城牆都是夯土牆，泥土就地挖取，故有城牆必有護城河。護城河中古前常稱 “ 池 ” ，與 “ 城 ” 並用。
魏晉後，常稱 “ 壕 ” ，範圍大於 “ 池 ” ，有更明確的軍事防禦性質。
塹，指深險難越的護城河。
隍，水乾涸的護城河。
