# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for flourishing or thriving of any kind, abstract or concrete is shèng [[盛]] (ant. shuāi [[衰]] "decline").
2. Chāng [[昌]] and xīng [[興]] (all ant. wáng [[亡]] "be ruined"), and lóng [[隆]] (ant. tì [[替]] "decline") refer primarily to the flourishing of political institutions and the like.
3. Xí [[息]], zhí [[殖]], and fān [[蕃]] refer specifically to the flourishing of flora and fauna.
4. The literal word for luxuriant growth of plants is mào [[茂]] (ant. diāo [[凋]] "dried up").
5. Róng [[榮]] (ant. kū [[枯]] "dried up") refers especially to splendid luxuriance of growth as an admirable sight.
6. Fēng [[豐]] (ant.* wěi [[萎]] "dried up and thin on the ground") refers to rich thick growth, often as an asset.
7. Fān [[蕃]] and yù [[鬱]] (mostly reduplicated yù yù [[鬱鬱]] ) refer to ample thick growth.
8. Fú shū [[扶疏]] is a poetic word referring to luxurious growth of plants.
NB: There is a remarkable abundance of terminology in this semantic field, and in many cases the distinctions are less than clear.
