STRIKE USING a WHIP.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Cè 策 refers to flaying an animal or a person with a bamboo whip, typically to urge the creature flayed on.
2. Biān 鞭 refers to flaying someone with a leather strap whip.
3. Pū 扑 "beat" is sometimes said to involve the whip, but I have not seen any clear evidence for this.
NB: For chī 笞 "strike with a bamboo cane or stick" and the like see STRIKE.
