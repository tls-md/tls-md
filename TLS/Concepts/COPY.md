# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general (but rare) word for producing a copy of something written or sculpted etc, is xiě [[寫]] (ant.* [[著]] "compose" and zuò [[作]] "make").
2. Mó [[摹]] (ant.* shū [[書]] "produce calligraphy") refers to making a mechanical copy of a piece of calligraphy from Han times onwards.
3. Xí [[襲]] (ant.* zuò [[作]] "create") refers to unauthorised or unacknowledged copying, but this usage is mostly post-Buddhist.
NB: Lín [[臨]] "make a close copy of a painting" is post-Buddhist (TANG).
