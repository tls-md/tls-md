## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most common word for an artificial lake of any kind is chí [[池]], and this word typically refers to a meandering lake, sometimes close in shape to a moat, particularly round elevated terraces and the like, around gardens and orchards, but also as part of palaces.
2. Zhǎo [[沼]] is an elevated word referring to elaborate artificial lakes in or near palaces and the like, although the word can also come to refer more generally to natural lakes and marshlands.

池，沼
1. WL maintain that in the meaning "pond, pool" the words are completely synonymous.  This is certainly not so.  Zha3o 沼 is a dignified word belonging to an elevated style, hence li2ng zha3o 靈沼 and never li2ng chi2 靈池.  Zha3o 沼 is often deep and round, with fish typically diving deep into it, whereas chi2 池 can be elongated and curved, as in qu3 chi2 曲池 "winding lakes". The association of zha3o 沼 is with palaces and the like, that of chi2 池 is with platforms and orchards, gardens, orchards.  There is no 園沼 nor is there a pu3 zha3o 圃沼.  These are chi2 池. Lakes hu2 湖 are associated with chi2 池 "ponds" as sources for food, never zha3o 沼, which are too elevated to be used for such mundane purposes. 
YTL 04.17.05; Wang 1992: 153; Wang 1995: 220; Lu: 235; tr. Gale 1931: 107;
食湖池， Indeed with him who feeds on the Nation掇 lakes and pools
Chi2 池 are often (though by no means always) mundane things, zha3o 沼 never are.  Thus we always have the proverbial jiu3 chi2 酒池 and no jiu3 zha3o 酒沼.  A king might go out to shoot birds at a chi2 池 "meandering lake" somewhere, but the zha3o 沼 tend to be near or within the confines of palaces and the like:
HSWZ 09.10.01; tr. Hightower 1951, p.298f
齊景公出弋昭華之池， Duke Ching of Ch剫 went on a shooting expedition to the lake at Chao-hua.
The constant reference to ga1o ta2i she1n chi2 高臺深池 suggests that the chi2 池 were those places where the earth for the platforms was taken, just as in the case of city walls.
