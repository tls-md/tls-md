# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Current general word for a ladder is tī [[梯]], and it refers to the movable construction made ussually of wood which can be used to climb a wall, floor etc. The term is often used for the ladders used to attack city walls.
2. Gōu yuán [[鉤援]] refers in SHIJING probably to a ladder with hooks to climb city walls. (According to some scholars, the term refers to the crooked and straight weapons, but it seems less probable in a context in which the words are found.)
