# Definition
BIG CLOTH USED to SAFEGUARD SLEEPING HUMANS AGAINST the COLD WHILE they SLEEP.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[[CONGERIES]]
1. Bèi [[被]] is a general term for a blanket, and the word perhaps has something of a colloquial flavour.
[FAMILIAR?]
2. Qīn [[衾]] is probably the most common general word for a blanket, but the word also has specific uses where it emphasises the large size of a blanket. Ancient Chinese blankets were generally made with "silk-cotton, silk floss" miǎn [[綿]] (not identical with modern miánhuā [[棉花]] ) or hemp fillings. This type of blanket was important in funeral rites.
3. Chóu [[裯]] refers to a single-layered thin blanket.
4. Rèn [[衽]] refers to a thin blanket covering a mattress rù [[褥]]. See MAT.
5. Qiǎng [[襁]] refers to a small wrapping blanket which packs up babies to be carried on one's back.
6. Bǎo [[褓]] refers generally to a small blanket used to protect a child against the cold.
7. Qǐn yī [[寢衣]] refers to a relatively short blanket under which to sleep when it is not too cold, maybe even a kind of pyjamas (but note that in China as in the Middle Ages in Europe one tended to sleep naked, apparently).
