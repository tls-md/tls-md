# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria

[GENERAL or SPECIALISED]
[GRAMMATICALISED/LEXICAL]
[HIERARCHICAL/NON-HIERARCHICAL]
[MOVING/STATIONARY]
1. The general word for accompanying someone of superior status is probably shì [[侍]] refers to polite attendance upon a master or leader, typically while in residence, but occasionally also on journeys. See SERVE.
[ASCENDING], [STATIONARY]
2. Péi [[陪]] typically refers to accompanying someone who is moving, and it adds to the literal meaning of accompaniment of a superior that of general support.
[ASCENDING], [MOVING]
3. Jù [[俱]] and xié [[偕]] refer to a symmetric relation of togetherness rather than the transitive action of accompaniment of a superior. See TOGETHER.
[GENERAL], [NON-HIERARCHICAL]
4. Yǔ [[與]] adds to the notion of accompaniment that of tactical association, the siding with someone, and occasionally the latter nuance is stronger than the meaning "to accompany" so that the word comes to mean purely "to side with".
[DESCENDING!]

6. Co2ng [[從]] is to keep company as a follower.

## 
1. The person accompanied may be obligatorily of distinctly higher status (péi 陪, shì 侍 ), or that person may be of any status (jiē 偕, jù 俱, yǔ 與 )
2. The togetherness may be primarily in terms of physical vicinity (shì 侍, jiē 偕, péi 陪 ) or it may be in terms of forms of forms of collaborative togetherness that are not essentially spatial (yǔ 與 ).
3. The togetherness may include the notion of support (yǔ 與, péi 陪, shì 侍 ), or it may be more simply a matter of intentional spatial proximity (all others [JP]).
4. The notion of togetherness may be typically grammaticalised and adverbial (jiē 偕, jù 俱 ), or it may be ungrammaticalised and fully verbal (all others).
