# Definition
WALK OR TRAVEL INTENDING TO ARRIVE at a DEFINED PLACE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Zhī 之 is to go to a place, typically taking the most direct route, by any conveyance as a result of a decision and typically with the purpose of staying there for a while or conducting some business.
2. Cào/zào 造 and rú 如 refer to aiming for a destination, and the movement may be by foot or by any conveyance.
3. Wǎng 往 (ant. jū 居 "remain at home") refers to setting out for a destination by any means of transport or by foot, and the destination is not very often made explicit by an ordinary noun as object. Moreover wǎng 往 does not necessarily imply going somewhere by the most direct route.
4. Fù 赴 refers to hastening to a (typically dangerous) destination (such as an abyss or fire), or to a place where one is to perform a public duty.
5. Qū 趨 refers to hurrying politely to a destination.
6. Shì 適 refers to moving in a certain direction, or heading for a certain place, and the word is also used for arrival at the destination.
7. Jiù 就 (ant. qù 去 "leave") and the somewhat rarer jí 即 (ant. lí 離 "leave") refer to approaching a certain destination by any means of transport.
8. Yì 詣 refers to going somewhere to pay a formal visit. See VISIT.

往，去
1. WL fails to note the crucial link constituted by LEAVE, the difference being that wa3ng 往 is "to leave for, set out for", whereas qu4 去 is "to leave, go away from".

**王力古漢語字典** page 7
1. WL 7 maintains that wa3ng 往 cannot take direct objects.  For OBI this is manifestly wrong, for pre-Buddhist Chinese we have found many examples of wa3ng 往 with a direct object. When WL repeats that wa3ng 往 only became a transitive after the medieval period this is certainly quite mistaken.
2. Ya1n wa3ng 焉往 "where did he go" is common and should perhaps be taken as involving an indirect object, as WL assumes, but he2 wa3ng 何往 does of course occur in SHI, as WL fails to notice.
3. WL 7 takes the basic meaning of fu4 赴 to be 將身投入"throw one's body into", but the essential elements are   a. speed and   b. risk, and there is no suicidal nuance.
