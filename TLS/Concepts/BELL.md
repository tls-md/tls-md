# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
SEE ILLUSTRATIONS
1. The current general word for a bell of any kind is zhōng 鐘 / 鍾. When hung up singly, it is called tè zhōng 特鐘, with round opening as in illustration SUN JI. Rhythmic instrument. Also, hung up in a series of tuned bells, in two rows of eight bells each. Note that these bells were already rare by Han times. [In use mainly from the Western Zhou till the Warring States.]
[GENERAL]
2. Qìng 磬／罄 refers to music stones rather than bells, however, these "stones" could also be made of bronze.
3. Náo 鐃 small handbell with handle which is held in one hand and beaten with the other hand.
4. Zhēng 鉦 is a small bell with a handle like a náo 鐃, but somewhat larger, and not held in the hand but set up on a stand. It is used to order an army into retreat. (The gǔ 鼓 is used to order an army to attack.)
5. Líng 鈴 refers to a small bell with a handle at the top.
6. Duó 鐸 refers to a bell with a tongue which is similar to líng 鈴 but larger.
7. Chuí 棰 refers to a metal or wooden stick with which to strike bells of any kind from the outside in order sound the bell. See STICK
8. Yǔ 敔 is a rare word referring to a bell in the shape of a crouching tiger which is beaten using a bamboo stick. Apparently, this bell was only struck towards the end of a musical piece. [Mentioned in the YIJI chapter of the SHANGSHU. Description of the shape dates from the SONG. For a Chinese antiquity, I have not found any archaeological or pictorial evidence.]
9. Bó 鎛 refers to a kind of suspended bell which is similar to zhōng 鐘 / 鍾 but even larger. Bó 鎛 were suspended not in sets, but alone or in pairs.
10. Chún yú 錞于 refers to a special kind of bell.
11. Luán 鸞 is a bell fixed on vehicles and knives which was supposed to make a sound like a luán-bird or phoenix.
12. Luán 鑾 refers to a harness bell; probably identical with luán 鸞 : see LIJI.
13. Zhù 柷 refers in SHI to some kind of resonance box used in music, an instrument which was struck in the beginning of a musical piece.
