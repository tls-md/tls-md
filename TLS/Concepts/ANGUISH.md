## Old Chinese Criteria
[IMPERSONAL/PERSONAL]
[PRECISE/VAGUE]
[POETIC/PROSAIC]
[LASTING/TRANSITORY]
1. Jí 疾 (ant. kuài 快 "be delighted") is acute temporary or momentary anguish directed at a definite cause of dissatisfaction. See also HATE.
[PRECISE], [TRANSITORY]
2. Yùn 慍 (ant. yú 愉 "feel generally pleased") is lingering or lasting somewhat milder and more diffuse dissatisfaction or anguish. See ANGER. The distinction is miserably uncertain in many contexts.
[OVERT], [LASTING]
3. Fèn 憤 "pent-up dissatisfaction and resentment" (ant.* chàng 暢 "vent one's feelings freely" is not a regular antonym that is stylistically acceptable in parallelism) can be a general feeling of dissatisfaction without any concrete person to be dissatisfied about. See also ANGER.
[COVERT], [IMPERSONAL], [INTENSE], [LASTING]
4. Chàng 悵 (ant. xīn rán 欣然 "be pleased with oneself") is poetic and intensely personal without being directed at any particular person, and involves a strong element of despondency.
