# Definition
HINDER from being UNRESTRAINED.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for restraining something or someone is yuē 約 (ant. zòng 縱 "give free rein to").
2. Jié 節 (ant. sì 肆 "be unrestrained") always refers to abstract restraint and moderation, typically the restraint is directed towards oneself.
3. Jū 拘 (ant. dàng 蕩 "be completely free") and shù 束 refer to being confined or constrained by external circumstances.
4. Lè 勒 and kòng 控 (all ant. fàng 放 "set free") refer to a vigorous act of restraining someone or something by force.
5. Jī 羈 (ant. tuō 脫 "let loose") and yǐn 引 refer specifically to the reining in of horses by the use of a bridle, but the word also has generalised uses where it refers to restraint of other creatures.
