# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria

2. Yāo [[要]] refers to a rather formal invitation to a meal, a feast, or a stay, and the word never refers to an invitation to join a political movement or the like.
3. Pìn [[聘]] refers to a strictly formal diplomatic invitation.
4. Qǐng [[請]] comes to refer to a general social invitation by SHIJI times, but the word can also refer more generally to an invitation to join any activity or movement.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
邀請 is the current modern word referring (verbally or nominally) to an invitation.
請 is a current informal way of referring (always verbally) to an invitation.
約請 focusses on the need for agreement on the part of the invitee.
敦請 refers to a cordial invitation of a rather formal kind.
邀約 refers in a somewhat literary way to an invitation by mutual agreement.
特約 refers to a special invitation.
招要 refers in a very literary almost periphrastic way to a formal invitation.
