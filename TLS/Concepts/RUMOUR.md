RUMOUR
rumor "report, word-of-mouth" is the uncertain, often clandestine dissemination of hidden facts, and this is typically of interest only by its novelty, is an object of curiosity, and passes away with the generation in which it sprung up.
fama "information" is the open and public dissemination of some facts, and the fama is typically of interest through its importance, and will often be handed down to posterity as permanent knowledge.
