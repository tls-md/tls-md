# Definition
LOOK at AND UNDERSTAND a DOCUMENT.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word for reading out a written text (there was probably no silent reading in pre-Buddhist China) was dú 讀. See Platform Sutra Tanjing 2.8.4 for a nice example. NB: reciting texts for oneself was a way of studying these, so that by Han times the word sometimes came close to meaning "study".
2. Lǎn 覽, guān 觀, and dǔ 睹 can occasionally refer to the running one's eyes over a text (probably mumbling it in the process, but there is no evidence whatever to substantiate this assumption) and thus reading it.
3. Jiàn 見 can occasionally refer to the looking at a text to see what it says.
4. Fēng 諷 refers to the current practise of reading a certain text.
