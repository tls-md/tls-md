# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word for a room within a house is presumably shì [[室]], but note in traditional Chinese architecture many kinds of buildings may consist of exactly one room so that the distinction between house and room becomes blurred.
2. Qin [[寑]] refers specifically to the bedroom.
3. Xiāng [[廂]] refers to the the two rooms on the sides of the main room in the main building.
4. Fáng [[房]] refers to a non-main room in a building.
5. Táng [[堂]] refers to the (typically elevated) main sitting room or the main wing in any dwelling. See BUILDING.
