1. The most current general word for approaching or getting close to anything is jìn [[近]] (ant. yuàn [[遠]] "remove oneself far from").
[GENERAL], [LITERAL!]
2. Jí [[即]] and jiù [[就]] (all ant. lí [[離]] "leave, move away from") refer neutrally to moving close to a certain place.

[DRAMATIC], [LITERAL]
4. Fù [[附]] is to move very close up indeed to something, often getting attached to it.
[HIGH-DEGREE], [LITERAL]
5. Qīn [[親]] (NB: shū [[疏]] is not used as an antonym for this meaning.) refers primarily to moving intimately close to something.
[ELEVATED], [TRANSFERRED!]
6. Lín [[臨]] is often used in ways characteristic of the dignified court style, but the word also commonly refers to getting close to a place or time in a natural course of events.

## 
1. The main distinction in this group is the degree of closeness of approach: Fù 附 is closest, bó 薄 is almost but not quite as close, and the emphasis is not on the movement as such but on the resulting intimate closeness.
2. Some words are often abstract in reference and take event objects (lín 臨 ), others are predominantly concrete (pò 迫 ); the other words may refer to concrete as well as abstract closeness.
3. Some words can have abstract time subjects (like mìng 命 "lifespan") by Han times (lín 臨 ), others always commonly take all sorts of abstract subjects (jìn 近 ), still others take only concrete physical subjects (jí 即 ).
4. Some words refer to physical proximity (jí 即, fù 附, pò 迫, jiù 就 ) others to psychological as well as physical proximity (qīn 親 ).
5. Some words refer to the process of approaching but do typically involve semantically the arrival at the destination (jí 即, jiù 就, lín 臨 ); other words typically describe a movement within the proximity region of the destination (qīn 親, jìn 近 ). jiang
