## 
2. Some modes of attack are part of declared war and constitute regular and military campaigns (fá 伐, zhēng 征, tǎo 討 ), other modes of attack are explicitly secretive and certainly never formally involve declarations of war (fàn 犯, xí 襲, qīn 侵 ).
3. Some words express specific modalities of attack or forms of attack (xūn 燻 fumigation", guàn 灌 "flooding", wò 沃 "flooding", wéi 圍 "encirclement", fén 焚 "setting fire to", mén 門 "to attack the city gate").
4. Some words describe successful attacks without specifying whether they are open attacks or not, and without specifying any specific method of attack used (rù 入 "enter successfully", yǒu 有 "take possession of", jù 據 "occupy", lè 略 "take control of through violent attack")
5. Some words are prejorative or vituperative and refer to attacks that are not considered as morally justified by the user of the word (fàn 犯 "launch an attack against", qīn 侵 "invade"), others are positive in connotation (fá 伐, zhēng 征, tǎo 討 ); still others are neutral in the relevant respect (gōng 攻, gǔ 鼓 "beat the drums of attack against", jí 擊 "strike out against", xí 襲 "launch a surprise attack against).
6. Some verbs can take individual persons as subjects (gōng 攻, jí 擊 ), the others cannot normally be used in that way.
