# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. General word for a knife or dagger is dāo 刀. Knives were usually made of bronze, since the Warring States period of iron, and had many functions; they could be used as a weapon (already from the Shang period), to cut meal - particularly meat - or as a butcherer's knife, and to engrave or smooth something. According to the purpose, their shape and size also varied. WANG suggests that dāo 刀 refers only to the knives with a concave blade, which can be conveniently used to cut something, whereas these with the convex blade were primarily used for curving and smoothing, and were called xiao 削; but it seems improbable. Knives with the concave blade are known which for their large size can be used only like a weapon or to cut something; it should be further noted that the knife-shaped coins of the Warring States period, which have the concave blade, are called dāo 刀, and that even small concave knives used in Han times to smooth bamboo books are often referred to as shū dāo 書刀.
2. Xiāo 削 refers to the small knife with a concave blade, which was used to engrave or smooth wooden or bamboo surface. It was often used to smooth a surface of bamboo slips, and in Han times was usually referred to as shū dāo 書刀.
3. Bǐ shǒu 匕首 refers to the dagger defined in SHUOWEN like a short sword.
