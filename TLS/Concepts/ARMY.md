# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[ARCHAIC/CURRENT]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[IMPERSONAL/PERSONIFIED]
[MOBILE/STATIONARY]
[LARGE/SMALL]
1. Bīng [[兵]] "armed force" focusses on the weapons ready for use and may refer to any military grouping.
[GENERAL]
2. Jūn [[軍]] is a complete army as a unit, from Spring and Autumn times onwards, normally attached to an army camp. Complete parts of an army are always jūn [[軍]], rarely shī [[師]]. Hence the expressions sān jūn [[三軍]], zhōng jūn [[中軍]], shàng jūn [[上軍]], xià jūn [[下軍]]. An army is counted by the number of jūn [[軍]] in it, where each jūn [[軍]] is said to be 10 000 men, at least in the Qi system. Systems have varied in different states. For detals of the early history see the monograph by KOLB.
[IMPERSONAL], [LARGE], [OFFICIAL]
3. Shī [[師]] refers generally to troops a military force on a campaign, not necessarily a complete army. ZUO Ding 4.1.6 commentators quantify an armed force as consisting of 2500 men, in one exceptional context. One often speaks of [[三軍之師]], never of [[三師之軍]]. One asks for troops [[請]]／[[乞師]], and not for jūn [[軍]] which would be asking for the whole army of a friendly state. The troops of another state one uses are always shī [[師]] (e.g. [[衛人以燕師伐鄭]] ), one's own troops can be described as jūn [[軍]] or shī [[師]] almost indifferently. One offers food to the enemy shī [[師]], not to their jūn [[軍]]. (HF 23.27:01) There are ruì shī [[銳師]] "crack troops" but no ruì jūn [[銳軍]] "crack army". Similarly, [[楚師之良]]. The shī [[師]] may be said to hear about something [[師聞之]], not the jūn [[軍]].
[GENERAL], [MOBILE], [PERSONIFIED!]
4. Lu# [[旅]] is an archaic word for armed forces in any combatant or non-combatant function, and in ZUO Ding 4.1.6 it is quantified to consist of 500 men, and.
[ARCHAIC], [SMALL]
5. Duì [[隊]] is common in Han texts for a division in the army, the size of this division could vary, but did not exceed the hundreds. SEE ALSO BATALLION
[SMALL]

軍，師
1. WL maintains that in terms of size ju1n 軍 is larger than shi1 師.  This is misleading because shi1 師 "armed forces" is quite general and quite standardly is specified in terms to the three armies that make up a formal array of such armed forces:
ZUO Xuan 12.2.1 (597 B.C.); Ya2ng Bo2ju4n 721; Wa2ng Sho3uqia1n 521; tr. Watson 1989:86;  revised tr. CH 
夏六月， In summer, in the sixth month,
晉師救鄭。 the Ji4n army came to the rescue of Zhe4ng.
荀林父將中軍， Xu2n Li2nfu3 led the central army,
先縠佐之； Xia1n Gu3 assisted him.
士會將上軍， Shi4 Hui4 led the upper army,
郤克佐之； an Xi4 Ke4 assisted him.
趙朔將下軍， Zha4o Shuo4 led the lower army,
欒書佐之。 Lua2n Shu1 assisted him..
