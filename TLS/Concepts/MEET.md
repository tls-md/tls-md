# Definition
ENCOUNTER HUMANS, OFTEN VOLUNTARILY.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for meeting someone by coincidence is yù 遇, and going to meet someone is jiàn 見.
2. Huì 會 refers to an arranged meeting, usually between more than two persons.
3. Zāo 遭 refers to being exposed to something or running into someone, and the focus is on the fact that the encounter is generally hostile ( 遭宋司馬，將要而殺之 "ran into the Marshal of Sòng and wanted to kill him").
4. Féng 逢 seems to be a dialect word for encountering something, but in early times this word has a much more limited range of syntactic functions, while from Han times it tended to replace yù 遇 as the standard word for encountering a person, later to be replaced in colloquial Chinese by its cognate pèng 碰.
5. Chù 觸 is occasionally used to refer to someone bumping into someone else.
