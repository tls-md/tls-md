# Definition
TAKE SECRETLY OFFENDING the LAW.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for any form of stealing is qiè [[竊]] and this word in no way suggests that the person who steals is in fact a professional or habitual thief.
2. Dào [[盜]] refers to a clandestine operation of stealing that may be on a fairly small scale, but typically by a person who specialises in stealing, a dào [[盜]] "thief".
3. Rǎng [[攘]] refers specifically to an act of taking another's property from a place other than his own home.
4. Tōu [[偷]] refers to stealthy and illicit enjoyment or sometimes misappropriation of something.

竊，盜，賊
1. Qie4 竊 nearly always refers to very concrete and banal petty theft and is not at all synonymous with da4o 盜 which is robbery in general and may refer to large-scale highway banditry and robbery.
2. 
LH 33.14.3; Liu 529;
攻城襲邑， Attacking a city, harassing a town,
剽劫虜掠， robing and pillaging,
發則事覺， once it happens, this event will be found,
道路皆知盜也。 and all the wayfarers know the robbers.
穿鑿垣牆， But piercing a wall,
狸步鼠竊， sneaking like a cat, and stealing like a rat,
莫知謂誰。� (when this happens,) nobody know who do this.�
