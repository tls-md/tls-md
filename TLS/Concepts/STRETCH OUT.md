# Definition
CAUSE TO BECOME MORE LONG.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for stretching things so as to make them reach out longer is shēn [[伸]] (ant. suō [[縮]] "pull in").
2. Yán [[延]] (ant. tuì [[退]] "retract" and perhaps shōu [[收]] "contract") refers to the stretching out of something in one distinct direction.
3. Zhǎn [[展]] (ant. juǎn [[卷]] "roll up, fold up") specifically refers to the stretching out of things in several directions at the same time.
4. Shū [[舒]] (ant. juǎn [[卷]] "roll up, fold up") is rather marginal in this group and refers specifically to reaching or spreading out in several directions without necessarily remaining continuous in the process.
5. Shū [[攄]] (ant. xì [[翕]] refers to the (often abstract) expansion into a new area.
