# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for poverty is pín [[貧]] (ant. fù [[富]] "rich"), but the term does not in general refer to transitory poverty.
2. Qióng [[窮]] (ant. fù [[富]] "rich") refers to an extreme state of destitution, which may, however, be transitory, and the word may also refer not so much to poverty as such as marked lack of expected success, professional failure (ant. dá [[達]] ); and the word may also refer to persons without regular means of support such as widows and orphans.
3. Fá [[乏]] (ant. yù [[裕]] "abundantly supplied") refers to a shortage in a certain commodity or in a certain specified group of commodities.
4. Kùn [[困]] (ant.* kuān [[寬]] "in comfortable economic circumstances") refers to poverty as constituting serious hardship.
5. Yuē [[約]] (ant. chuò [[綽]] "be abundantly supplied") refers to mild poverty or straightened circumstances.
6. Jué [[絕]] refers to temporary poverty viewed as the result of a sudden change of circumstances.
7. Jié [[竭]] refers a state of extremely low supply that has come about through a gradual change in circumstances.
8. Jiǒng [[窘]] (ant. jǐ [[給]] "be sufficiently supplied") is a rare word referring to a general state of run-down destitution.

貧，窮
11. Ko3ng Yi2ngda2 孔穎達: 細言窮困於貧。A person without regular means of support is qio2ng 窮, and this may indeed refer to proper destitution, but the word may also refer to a temporary passing state of deprivation or an impasse, and this kind of poverty may be relative to expected affluence and thus not really poverty. Pi2n 貧 refers to the generally permanent status of someone of very limited means of subsistence, and the word cannot refer to a person who has come on hard times but is still rich by general standards as set of the class of really poor people.  WL does not get to the nerve of the distinction.
