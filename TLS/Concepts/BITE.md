# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[[COMMON/RARE]]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[HABITUAL/OCCASIONAL]
NB: Curiously, none of the words for "to bite" are particularly common in ancient Chinese literature.
1. Hé 齕 is a general word for biting, especially by dogs, and this word is not used adjectivally for "snappy, snappish".
[GENERAL]
2. Shì 噬 and refers to any person or animal biting into anything, also for dogs being prone to bite, snappy.
[HABITUAL!]
3. Zhuó 啄 is the pecking (or biting) of birds.
[SPECIFIC]
4. Yǎo 咬 refers very occasionally to the noise of gnashing one's teeth and the word is only mentioned in this group because by Tang times it came to mean "bite".
[SPECIFIC]; [[RARE+]]
5. Niè 齧／囓 is occasionally used to refer to the biting by a dog.
