# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for a discursive "analytical" explanation of something that is not sufficiently clear in itself is shuō [[說]].
2. Yán [[言]] refers to the explicit articulation of something, and the emphasis often is on the initiative taken to undertake this explanation.
3. Chén [[陳]] refers to the laying out of something clearly so as to make it accessible to an overview and a clear understanding of the contents of what is laid out, and the social context is typically that of an inferior laying something out for superiors.
4. Míng [[明]] is to throw intellectual light on something by any means, including illustration as well as historical explanation or definition.
5. Yù [[喻]] / [[諭]] refers to making clear to others what is very clear to oneself, and the means is often comparsion or illustration, yù [[諭]] tending to be used for making something clear through words in later texts, and yù [[喻]] for explanation by comparison or metaphor.
6. Jiě [[解]] refers primarily to the unravelling of something that would appear convoluted and non-transparent without the effort of intellectual unravelling.
7. Shì [[釋]] is late and refers to explanation with special reference to individual difficult points.
8. Shù [[述]] refers to laying out for others what oneself or others have done or said in the past.
9. Xù [[敘]] refers to laying out something in an orderly manner, often in conversation with equals and in a confidential context, and the word became current in Han times.
