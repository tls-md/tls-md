# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for combining or linking things, or joining a new unit into an old one is jiān [[兼]] (ant. fēn [[分]] "be divided").
2. Hé [[合]] (ant. lí [[離]] "get separated off") is the combining of typically abstract items into a single whole.
3. Lián [[聯]] and the Han equivalent lián [[連]] (all ant. jué [[絕]] "break relations with") refer to the establishing of links without the creation of a new unity.
4. Huì [[會]] refers to the combination of separate units into a whole as in huì yì [[會意]] "complex characters where semantically significant elements retain their graphic significance".
5 Bìng [[並]] refers to the lining things up and joining them together. See ANNEX.
6. Zhuān [[專]] is occasionally used to refer to the combining or uniting of things. See CONCENTRATE
