HUMAN who is NOT CHINESE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Perhaps the most current general word for peoples who were taken not to belong to the Huáxiá [[華夏]] community is yí dí [[夷狄]], but sometimes the term refers specifically to the eastern and the northern barbarians.
2. Jiǔ yí [[九夷]] is another term referring generically to the peoples who were taken not to belong to the Huáxiá [[華夏]] community, but more specifically to those of the East.
3. Sì dí [[四狄]] is a general term for the various types of peoples that were not taken to belong the Huáxiá [[華夏]] community, but more specifically to those of the north. Sometimes the term wǔ yí [[五夷]] is used.
4. Róngdí [[戎狄]] is another term referring generically to the peoples who were taken not to belong to the Huáxiá [[華夏]] community, but also more specifically to the western and northern barbarians.
5. Mán yí [[蠻夷]] is another term referring generically to the peoples who were taken not to belong to the Huáxiá [[華夏]] community.
One standard classification of non-Chinese peoples is this:
6. Yí [[夷]] refers to the barbarians of the east, but the term came to be used for barbarians generally. [[東方為九夷]]，
7. Mán [[蠻]] refers specifically to the barbarians of the south. [[南方為八蠻]]，
8. Róng [[戎]] refers specifically to the barbarians of the west. [[西方為六戎]]，
9. Dí [[狄]] refers specifically to the barbarians of the north. [[北方為五狄]]。
In addition there is a rich vocabulary specifying various non-Chinese ethnic groups.
