# Definition
ARTEFACT of TIED THREADS, CONTAINING MANY BIG HOLES BETWEEN the THREADS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general term for a net is probably wǎng [[网]] (originally specifically a fishing net) and gǔ [[罟]], (originally also specifically a fishing net). It seems that both terms referred originally not only to the fishing net, but to a net in general; already in bone inscriptions and then in SHIJING wǎng [[网]] is mentioned like a net used to catch animals.
2. Luó [[羅]], wǎng [[罔]]／[[網]], bì [[畢]], fú [[罘]], and jū [[罝]] (small) are current words for bird nets which can also be used to catch small animals like hares. [Bì [[畢]] was probably of Y-like shape, and consisted of small net and long handle. The word wǎng [[罔]]／[[網]] is probably only archaic variant of wǎng [[网]]. In SHIJING, the word is used also for a fish net. Fú [[罘]] can be also used to catch large animals like deers.
3. Zēng [[罾]], gū [[罛]], yù [[罭]] are current names for fish nets.
4. Hǎn [[罕]] refers to a small bird net with long handle; perhaps it refers to the same implement like bì [[畢]].
5. Zhāng [[張]] is usually a verb meaning 'to catch (birds or animals) with a net', but it can also refer to a net for hunting.
6. Weì [[罻]] refers to a small net for catching birds.
7. Chōng [[罿]] refers to a small bird net.
8. Juàn [[罥]] refers to a bird net.
9. Fú CHARACTER??? is a mechanism used to catch birds or animals. It was perhaps a carriage with two shafts, among which was spread a net. Mentioned already in SHIJING. [HUANG 1995: 448 - 449; XIANG 1997: 163]
