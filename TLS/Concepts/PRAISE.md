# Definition
SPEAK about something GOOD and NOT COMMON in ANOTHER HUMAN, ANIMAL OR THING.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for praise is yù 譽 (ant. huǐ 毀 "speak ill of"), and the word often refers to straightforward objective praise rather than eulogy..
2. Chēng 稱 (ant. bang 謗 "speak ill of behind his back") refers to "honourable mentioning" in public contexts and favourable public assessment of someone.
3. Bāo 褒 (ant. biǎn 貶 "make derogatory remarks about") refers to a person with a certain authority passing a positive judgment on someone.
4. Jiā 嘉 (ant. sǔn 損 "make belittling remarks about") refers to commending someone for a certain action or for past behaviour.
5. Zàn 讚／贊 "eulogise" (ant. dǐ 詆 "speak ill of") refers to lyrical, typically exaggerated and overly enthusiastic praise.
6. Sòng 頌 (ant. zhòu 咒 "make calumniatory remarks about") refers literally to the singing of someone's praises, but as in English, the praising thus described may actually be in ornate prose.
7. Měi 美 and shàn 善 (all ant. wù 惡 "speak ill of") refer to the bringing out of positive, admirable or morally commendable aspects in something or someone through discourse.
8. Yáng 揚 (ant. yì 抑 "do down") refers to the spreading of the good name of someone or something.

LAUS, LAUDATIO
332. Inter Laudem et laudationem. Laus est ejus qui laudatur; Laudatio vero ejus qui laudat. Item laus est in qua virtus enitet; laudatio, ipsa laudantis oratio [ Al., laudatio orationum]. Laus et laetitia [ Al., laudem laetitiam,] sine celebratione vocis in animi admiratione consistit: laudatio vero rei cujusque praedicatio est, adminiculo orationis ornata.

譽，讚／贊
1. WL fails to mention the current graph za4n 贊 "praise" for the later za4n 讚 which in fact is unattested in pre-Buddhist Chinese literature.  The two terms compared in WL do not make a good natural pair to compare.
