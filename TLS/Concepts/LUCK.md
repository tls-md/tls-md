福，祿
1. The antonym of fu2 福 "good fortune" is huo4 禍 "stroke of bad fortune, misfortune".  The traditional rationalising gloss 爵命為福，賞賜為祿 is not relevant to most usages of the word and certainly not helpful for the interpretations of the texts where the words occur.  HF is much earlier and certainly more relevant to current Warring States usage:
HF 20.10:03; jishi 341; jiaozhu 188; shiping 615
全壽富貴之謂福。  Achieving a full measure of long life, wealth and nobility is called good fortune.
Wa2ng Cho21ng has an important explanation:
LH 2; Liu 1990:10; Beida1979:22; Yang 1999:12; Zheng 1999: 209; Guizhou 1993: 21; Hunan 1997: 11; tr. Forke 2.37
禍福之至， The arrival of happiness and misfortune,
幸不幸也。 is a matter of good or bad luck.
故曰： Therefore it is said:
得非己力， Because one gets good fortune not through one's own efforts
故謂之福； therefore good fortune is called good fortune;
來不由我， because misfortune comes not from oneself
故謂之禍。 therefore misfortune is called misfortune.
2. The definition of fu2 福 as lu4 祿 is fair enough when lu4 祿 refers to blessings from Heaven, but even then the difference remains that fu2 福 refers to either a fortunate outcome, or a state of comfortable good fortune which are on occasion construed as the result of one's own actions, whereas lu4 祿 are apparently always blessings construed as coming from Heaven unaffected by human action.  Re2n jie1 qiu2 fu2 人皆求福, but when one ga1n lu4 干祿 what one seeks is an official stipend that goes with public employment, not good fortune as such.
