2. Some verbs designate distant admiration (gāo 高, shàng 尚, wàng 望 ), others include the aspiration to equal the object admired (mù 慕 ).
3. Some verbs designate an admiration for something that need not be distant (měi 美 ), others empasise the distance between admirer and the admired (yǎng 仰, zhān 瞻 ).
