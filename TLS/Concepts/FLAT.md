## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word for flatness of any kind is píng [[平]] (ant. qīng [[傾]] "slanted downwards on one side" and perhaps xié [[斜]] "sloping") and it refers to anything which is horizontal and lacks inclination.
2. Yí [[夷]] (ant. xiǎn [[險]] "precarious or difficult of access (of terrain)" and yì [[易]] mostly refers to terrain and its accessibility through lack of geographical impediments.
3. Tǎn [[坦]] (dǒu [[陡]] "steep") has no special pragmatic connotations and simply refers to the objective property of a an area without noticeable elevations.
