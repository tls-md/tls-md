HAPPEN FEW TIMES ONLY.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for seldom is hǎn [[罕]] (ant. lu# [[屢]] "fairly often), which tends to refer to a very low fequency of occurrence of something.
2. Xiǎn [[鮮]] (ant. cháng [[常]] "frequently, in the natural course of events") refer to a dramatic degree of scarcity.
3. Xī [[希]] / [[稀]] (ant. shuò [[數]] "repeatedly, many times, several times") refers to relative scarcity or sparseness both in time and in space.
4. Shǎo [[少]] (ant. duō [[多]] "often") is a colourless word frequently used to indicate non-specifically that something is not often seen.
