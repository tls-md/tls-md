# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for a plough of any kind is sì [[耜]], but the word can refer specifically to the hand pullen plough with a cross-bar to step on. [Sì [[耜]] resembles a spade with a broader head made of wood, bone, stone, since the Warring States also iron, and it could be also used to dig earth. Originally, the word referred specifically to the just described kind of implement, but since the Han period when real oxen-pulled plough came to common use (see below), the term became the general word for a plough of any kind.
2. Lěi [[耒]] is the most ancient form of a typically hand-pulled plough with one (later in Han times two) wooden ploughshare which is held in the hand on an upper cross-bar and stepped on on a lower cross-bar, but this character is rarely used on its own. When in the construction lěi sì [[耒耜]] this refers to a lěi [[耒]] -type sì [[耜]], i.e. a shovel-like plough with a long handle and cross-bars to tread on and to hold on to. [It is not easy to distinguish between lěi [[耒]] and sì [[耜]] in ancient texts; moreover, as noted above, both terms has a long history and can refer to different implements in different periods. It seems that main distinctions between both were probably originally as follows: lěi [[耒]] was simple crooked wooden stick with upper and lower cross-bar, whereas sì [[耜]] more resembled spade with broader head (see above). The latter could be also used to dig earth, and sometimes can not be easily distinguished from chā [[臿]]. Already in the Chunqiu period, lěi [[耒]] and sì [[耜]] were combined together, and this implement can be referred to as lěi [[耒]], sì [[耜]], or lěi sì [[耒耜]]. Since its handle was more lěi [[耒]] -like, and its head more sì [[耜]] -like, the word lěi [[耒]] can also refer to the handle of the implement, and sì [[耜]] to its head. In Han times, all these terms can refer to a plough generally (including oxen-pulled plough of the lí3 [[犁]] type; see below), or specifically to each kind of implement which were just described, and which all survived to the Han period.
3. Lí3 [[犁]] is a plough driven, originally, by three people, one guiding the plough-share, the other two pulling the plough. The plow-pullers were replaced by oxen at the stage where the modern current character was developed. The lí [[犁]] currently pulled by oxen by Han times had iron plough shares. [It is not clear when this kind of plough came to use. Some scholars interpret finds of triangular stone implements known from the Neolithic like evidence for this kind of plough, but it should be noted that all these artefacts come from the southern part of China, far apart from the core area of the later states of the 2nd and 1st millenium B.C. In fact, from northern China there is no convincing evidence for this kind of plough prior to the late Chunqiu. Moreover, it is not clear when the plough began to be pulled by an oxen; the oldest evidence for a pulling oxen also dates from the late Chunqiu period. In the Warring States and particularly in the Han, oxen-pulled plough came to common use, and there are many finds of iron ploughshares from these periods. It should be noted that even in that time, this kind of plough was not ussually referred to as lí3 [[犁]] in texts, but rather as lěi [[耒]] or sì [[耜]]. The term lí3 [[犁]] was probably a colloquial word.
4. Yōu [[耰]] is an agricultural tool used to cover seed with earth. [Wooden mallet used to break pieces of earth. This implement is relatively often referred to in texts of the Chunqiu and Warring States period. It is not known from archaeological finds (for being made of wood), but there are pictorial presentations in hand.
5. Lóu [[耬]] refers to the seeding plough invented in Han times.
