2. Piān 偏 "onesided" (ant. zhèng 正 "straight and level") typically refers to abstract imbalance.
3. Xié 斜 (ant. zhèng 正 "straight and level") refers to any concrete object or movement being neither upright nor horizontal, and the word is first attested in HUANGDINEIJING.
4. Zè 仄 (ant. píng 平 "level") refers specifically to the sun being in a less than perpendicular position vis-a-vis the observer.
5. Dǒu 陡 (ant. píng 平 "level") refers specifically to the slanted nature of terrain.

斜，邪
1. The fact that an early LIJI edition is reported to have 斜 for xie2 邪 does not affect the general rule that xie2 斜"slanted" is completely unattested in early literature, and that when it is attested in the medical literature it is physical, and that xie2 邪 "deviant, immoral, wicked" is common and always figurative in meaning.  WLs comment is thus quite misleading when it says 古本通用.
