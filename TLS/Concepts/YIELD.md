# Definition
Be POLITE, USING RITUAL MODERATION AND PERMIT OTHERS to ACT as they DESIRE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The dominant general word referring to yielding politely to others or giving precedence to them is ràng [[讓]] (ant. líng [[陵]] "treat without proper respect").
2. Qiān [[謙]] (ant. jiāo [[驕]] "arrogant in attitude" and ào [[傲]] "impolite and arrogant in action") refers to the general attitude or disposition towards giving precedence to others.
3. Cí [[辭]] (ant. shòu [[受]] "accept") refers to declining politely an offer that has been made to one.
4. Xiè [[謝]] (ant. shòu [[受]] "accept") refers to informally but politely declining something offered to one in private context.
5. Shàn [[禪]] refers specifically to declining the high office of an emperor.
NB: Lǐ [[禮]] "treat with proper yielding politeness" is marginal in this group.
