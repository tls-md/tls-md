# Definition
BOUNDARY BETWEEN FIELDS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general term, at least from Han times onwards, is qiān mò 阡陌. This term is mostly used generically or in the plural. Occasionally the word is also used to refer to the area surrounded by qiān mò 阡陌. Qiān 阡 is rarely used on its own.
2. Quǎn 畎／甽 are little canals of water between fields, for drainage.
3. Mò 陌 can refer on its own to mudpaths between fields.
4. Pàn 畔 refers to the borderline between whole fields crossed individually by qiān mò 阡陌.
