# Criteria and general notes

1. The current standard word for a nest for birds or dwelling of an animal living on trees is cháo [[巢]], but the word does specifically refer to bird's nests in trees rather than on the ground.
NB: Qī [[棲]] is used to refer to what one perches on as a bird, i.e. a perch, but never to a nest as such.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
