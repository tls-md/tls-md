# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard word for the punishment by branding is qíng 黥, and this cruel practice is already mentioned in SHU, although it first became current in Han times, when it was currently applied to tutors as punishment for their distinguished pupils' transgressions.
2. Mò 墨 "black-branding" is also mentioned in SHU, but the practice was never wide-spread.
3. Qián 黔 is very occasionally used for self-inflicted darkening of the skin, possibly branding.
