# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current word for sitting is not properly zuò [[坐]] (see KNEEL) but probably jū [[居]] "sit down", which is a decorous thing to do, although it is not clear in which position, exactly, one ends up, and the suspicion is that one ends up, in fact, kneeling politely in the zuò [[坐]] fashion.
2. Dūn [[蹲]] is to squat on the floor, sitting on one's behind, but keeping a certain decorous pose.
3. Jù [[踞]] refers to squatting with one's legs spread to both sides, which was regarded as a very informal and impolite thing to do in public.
4. Jí [[集]] refers to birds settling in a certain place, often but not always in a flock.

蹲，踞，坐
1. WL describes the physical distinction correctly, but omits the crucial point that du1n 蹲 in the meaning "squat" is rare indeed in pre-Buddhist literature on the one hand, and that there is a crucial difference in decorousness between the words in question: zuo4 坐 is formal and correct, du1n 蹲 is informal but acceptable and unprovocative, ju4 踞 is highly informal and provocatively so.  There is nothing self-evident in the social valuation of du1n 蹲.
