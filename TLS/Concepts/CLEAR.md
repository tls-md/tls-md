1. The most general standard and clearly dominant word for things that are easily accessible to the intellect and to the senses is míng [[明]] (ant. hūn [[昏]] "unclear").
2. Zhāng [[彰]] (ant. yǐn [[隱]] "obscure") is an elevated word for something being clear to the intellectual eye.
3. Zhāo zhāo [[昭昭]] refers emphatically to perfect transparency and clarity.
4. Chéng [[澄]] (ant. hún [[混]] "opaque") prototypically refers to the unruffled, clear state of water or the like. See PURE
5. Primarily physical transparency is qīng [[清]] and the very rare chè [[澈]] (all ant. zhuó [[濁]] "muddled and unclear"). See PURE
