# Definition
IDEA insofar as SHOWN:expressed OR INTENDED.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for a person or an expression meaning something is yán [[言]]. X [[言]] Y comes to mean "X means Y".
2. Yì [[意]] is the standard word for meaning as "what one has in mind".
3. Zhì [[志]] is commonly used to refer to an inteneded meaning as expressive of a mental orientation.
4. Yuē [[曰]] "be called", the equivalent of wèi zhī [[謂之]], is the converse of yán [[言]] : X [[曰]] Y comes to mean "for X one says Y", or "X is called Y".
5. Zhǐ [[指]] is used as technical term for intended objective meaning in philosophical contexts.
6. Zhǐ [[旨]] is a stylistically elevated term which refers nominally to the overall import of what is said or written.
7. Wèi [[謂]] refers to what a person or an expression is intended to refer to as an object or as the intended meaning, or to the semantic process itself.
8. Zhī wèi [[之謂]] "refers to, is intended to refer to" belongs not so much to linguistics or lexicography as to the hermeneutics concrete interpretation of a given text.

義，意
1. WL is right about the distinction between subjective yi4 意 and objective yi4 義, but the main opposition between "subjective meaning" and "intention" is not brought out properly.
