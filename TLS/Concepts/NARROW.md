# Definition
SMALL in the MORE SMALL DIMENSION.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for narrowness is xiá [[狹]] (ant. kuān [[寬]] "broad") which refers quite generally to the small size of any opening.
2. Ài [[隘]] typically, but not always, connotes difficult military access.
3. Lòu [[陋]] (ant.* kuò [[闊]] "in grand style") refers only indirectly to narrowness of a street as an indication of its undistinguished character. The word focusses on this undistinguished character and is quite marginal in this group.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
