# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Yè [[夜]] (ant. zhòu [[晝]] "daytime", and rì [[日]] "day (when it is bright)") is the general term referring to the part of the day when it is dark, i.e. the evening and the night.
2. Xiāo [[宵]] (ant. zhòu [[晝]] ) refers to the night only, without including the evening, and the reference is not to the length of time so much as to the absence of sunlight.
3. Yè fēn [[夜分]] (ant. rì zhōng [[日中]] "midday") refers to midnight.
4. Sù [[宿]] refers to a night as what is spent in a hostel, or as the time one uses for sleep.
5. Míng [[冥]] is occasionally used to refer, by synecdoche, to the night as the time when it is dark.
