# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[OBJECT-SCOPE/PREDICATE-SCOPE/SUBJECT-SCOPE]
[ADDITIVE/ADVERSATIVE]
1. Yòu 又 which focusses on the predicate "(THE SUBJECT) moreover also (PREDICATES)".
[PREDICATE-SCOPE]
2. Yì 亦 which focusses on the subject "also (THE SUBJECT) likewise (PREDICATES)".
[SUBJECT-SCOPE]
3. Qiě 且 focusses on the whole sentence or the whole predicate and indicates that "also (SENTENCE2) (IN ADDITION TO SENTENCE 1) is/was true" or that "also VERB PHRASE 2 IN ADDITON TO VERB PHRASE 1 applies".
[SENTENCE-SCOPE]
4. Yóu 猶／由 "still, also" typically has an adversative nuance.
[ADVERSATIVE]

## 
1. Yòu 又 has the predicate as its scope and claims that the predicate applies in addition to other predicates; yì 亦 has the subject as its scope and claims that the subject, in addition to other subjects is characterised correctly by the predicate; qiě 且 has the whole sentence as its scope and claims that this sentence expresses something that holds true in addition to other things.
2. Yòu 又 is typically additive in nuance "in addition, also" and very rarely contrastive; yì 亦 is regularly contrastive "nonetheless also; nonetheless also, in spite of the difference", but this contrastive effect is sometimes neutralised to produce the effect of a pure "also the subject". Qiě 且 is emphatically pure in its additive nuance and always means "in addition, also", never anything like "in addition nonetheless it is also true...".
3. Qiě 且 has a modal function and regularly introduces non-narrative new considerations, whereas yòu 又 is rarely used in theoretical contexts to means something like "the something is moreover also characterised in general by the predicate". Yì 亦 is common both in narrative ( 亦云 "they concurred") and in non-narrative ( 亦然 "be also like that") contexts.
