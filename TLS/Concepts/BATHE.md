# Definition
WASH one's BODY OR PARTS of one's BODY.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[COMMON/RARE]
[FORMAL/INFORMAL]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[GENERAL-USE/TECHNICAL-TERM]
1. The standard general word is yù 浴 and refers typically to taking a bath or washing of the whole body. The still more general word, which may even apply to washing things other than the body, is zhuó 濯.
[GENERAL], [GENERAL-USE]; [[COMMON]]
2. Tāng 湯 emphasises the use of warm water, and standardly co-occurs with mù 沐 "wash one's body including one's hair", probably because the use of hot water was largely restricted to the washing of hair. Perhaps one should often interpret tāng 湯 adverbially as "with hot water" in this idiomatic connection.
[GENERAL-USE], [SPECIFIC]
3. Guàn 盥 is to wash one's hands, often in a ritual context.
[FORMAL], [TECHNICAL-TERM]
4. Zǎo 澡 "washing one's hands" is a specialised term which is sometimes used in wider senses.
[GENERAL-USE]
5. Xǐ 洗 "wash one's feet" but the word is is sometimes used in a more generalised way, being especially common in the context of ritualised formal bathing, as well as in the context of ritual washing of cups. See WASH
[FORMAL]; [[RARE]]
