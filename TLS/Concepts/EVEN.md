# Definition
SURPRISINGLY, EVEN-IF one would NOT have GUESSED, ALSO.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current word to make explicitly concessive nominals is suī [[雖]].
2. E@r [[而]] is restricted to subordinate clauses, and the word stresses the subjective incongruousness, thus coming close to being a counterfactual "even".
3. Yóu [[猶]] stresses the objective unlikeliness of the subject being characterised by the predicate.
NB: Lián [[連]] is post-Buddhist (MING)
## Modern Chinese Criteria
連
甚或
甚至
