# Definition
LANGUAGE of CHINA.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. guānhuà [[官話]] "Mandarin" is obsolete, and its traditional antonym was xiāngyǔ [[鄉語]] "local speech".
From Míng Dynasty times, this was a current word for the common vernacular language used by administrative staff of any kind throughout China.
DC: [[明何良俊]]《[[四友齋叢說]] ‧ [[史十一]]》： " [[雅宜不喜作鄉語]]，[[每發口必官話]]。 "

2. báihuà [[白話]] "plain speech, vernacular" (as opposed to wényán [[文言]] )
This is a modern word referring to an easily accessible written version of the Chinese language. In classical contexts or early vernacular contexts the expression always seems to refer to "empty talk" rather than the vernacular language.

3. guóyǔ [[國語]] "national language" (ant. wàiyǔ [[外語]] ) (pre-1950ies and Taiwan)
A word that continues to be in increasing common use even in Mainland China today, and which is standard in places like Malaysia or Singapore, as well as in Taiwan.

4. zhōngguóyǔ [[中國語]] "language of China" (ant. wàiguóyǔ [[外國語]] )
Current Japanese way of writing the Japanese word for the Chinese language, but the expression has a long history in China, the first attested use being in Yáng Xióng's Model Sayings of the first century BC.

5. pǔtōnghuà [[普通話]] "common language" (Mainland China) (ant. dìfāngyǔ [[地方語]], fāngyán [[方言]] "dialect (not in the ancient meaning)")
This is a very common modern expression which corresponds to Greek koinē, and the word is always used in counterdistinction to (often mutually incomprehensible) dialects. The word has a rather political flair.

6. Hànyǔ [[漢語]] "language of the Hàn people" (should include all dialects, but is often used otherwise)
This is the most current word for the Chinese language as opposed to other [[族語]] "national languages". The word is very current in the Buddhist Tripitaka, but it is also attested elsewhere [[庾信]]《[[奉和法筵應詔]]》： " [[佛影胡人記]]，[[經文漢語翻]]。 ". The term is also attested in [[世說新語]].

7. Zhōngguóhuà [[中國話]] "Chinese speech" (includes all dialects)
This word is always used in counterdistinction to foreign languages. It has become current in international contexts in nineteenth century novels.

8. Zhōngwén [[中文]] "Chinese (typically written) language" (ant. wàiwén [[外文]], often icludes speech: [[會說中文]] )
This word is already attested in the medieval [[搜神記]], where it refers to the written language. In Modern Standard Chinese this is a very common way of referring to Chinese as opposed to foreign languages, and as a subject in school curricula.

9. Huáyǔ [[華語]] "Chinese talk" (used mainly in Singapore, Hong Kong etc.)
This word has a long history in Buddhist texts, and it is also already attested in [[劉知幾]]《[[史通]] ‧ [[言語]]》： "... [[必諱彼夷音]]，[[變成華語]].

10. Hànyīn [[漢音]] "Han-Chinese sounds" refers to the Chinese language in a poetic style. Sanskrit is currently referred to as [[梵音]].
HD sub verbo [[漢文]]： 2. [[漢語]]；[[漢字]]。[[南朝梁僧祐]]《[[梵漢譯經音義同异記]]》： " [[或善梵義而不了漢音]]，[[或明漢文而不曉梵意]]。 "
HD: 2. [[指漢語]]。[[南朝宋朱廣之]]《[[咨顧道士]]＜[[夷夏論]]＞》： " [[想茲漢音]]，[[流入彼國]]。 "
[[老子漢人也]]。

11. Hàn yán [[漢言]] "Hàn language, language of the Hàn Dynasty> Chinese" (ant. [[胡言]] or [[胡語]] ) is a historico-ethnographic term.
This remained a very common way of referring to the Chinese language long after the Hàn Dynasty, as is clear from the Buddhist Tripitaka. (424 occurrences in CBETA.)

12. Wényán [[文言]] "literary Chinese" (ant. báihuà [[白話]] "plain vernacular") today refers to a modernised version of traditional classical Chinese, as used for example in letters. But in the Buddhist Tripitaka, for example, the phrase regularly refers to ornate Chinese, ornate formulations. Neither traditionally nor in modern times is [[文言]] used in counterdistinction to foreign languages: the contrast is with other varieties of Chinese.
DC: 4. [[別於白話的古漢語書面語]]。[[蔡元培]]《[[在國語傳習所的演說]]》： " [[文言上還有例句]]，[[如]] ' [[爾無我詐]]，[[我無爾虞]] ' [[等]]。 "

13. wényánwén [[文言文]] "literary Chinese writing" (ant. báihuàwén [[白話文]] ) refers to classical Chinese as it continues to be used in the introductions to books and in formal letter-writing.

This is a twentieth century word.

15. tōngyòngyǔ [[通用語]] "general use language".
This is a twentieth century neologism designed to replace [[普通話]]. The term has never achieved broad use.

16. dàzhòngyǔ [[大眾語]] "mass language" is obsolete today.
This is a politicised ideological concept stressing the universal use and popularity of the Chinese language as advocated by language politicians. It is a twentieth century political neologism.

17. guówén [[國文]] "state writing" refers in a formal way to written Chinese.
This is a twentieth century term mainly used in connection with educational politics.
