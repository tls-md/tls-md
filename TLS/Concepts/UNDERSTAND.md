# Definition
KNOW the BASIC PRINCIPLES of something COMPLEX.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard current and word for understanding something and knowing how to do something is zhī [[知]] (ant. mèi [[昧]] "not have the foggiest idea").
2. Míng [[明]] (ant. měng [[蒙]] "have very confused notions about") refers to incisive clarity of insight.
3. Tōng [[通]] (ant. hūn [[昏]] "be confused about") refers to comprehensive and thorough familiarity with a subject.
4. Yù [[喻]] / [[諭]] (ant. àn [[闇]] "be in the dark about") typically refers to clarity achieved on the basis of an effort of articulation.
5. Chá [[察]] and shěn [[審]] (ant. mí [[迷]] "be all lost when it comes to") refer to incisive clarity of understanding coupled with great awareness of the details of a matter.
6. Jīng [[精]] (mào [[眊]] / [[耄]] "be completely stupid with respect to") refers to a subtle and thorough understanding of something.
7. Shí [[識]] refers to familiarity with something concrete, but the word also refers to simple awareness, especially when negated.
8. Biàn [[辨]] / [[辯]] (ant. huò [[惑]] "be al confused about") refers to discriminating and highly articulate specialised, often professional knowledge about something.
9. Jué [[覺]] and the rarer wù [[悟]] are inchoative and refer to the coming to understand something.
10. Wēn [[溫]] refers to the resulting close familiarity after long acquaintance with a subject.
11. Wén [[聞]] (ant. wèi zhī wén [[未之聞]] "have never heard/learnt about any such thing") is sometimes used as a resultative verb meaning "come to understand something because one has been informed of it". But this usage is limited to the idiom wén dào [[聞道]] "hear about the Way".
12. Xī [[悉]] and jìn [[盡]] refer to presumed completeness in knowledge.

知，識，記，誌
1. WL claims that zhi1 知 is 一般的知道. In fact, whereas zhi1 知 is sometimes used in this colourless meaning, most of the time the word denotes a proper understanding of something.
2. WL claims that shi2 識 refers to a 比較深的認識. In fact, shi2 識 refers to the ability to recognise a person or a thing, and the word never refers to any deeper acquaintance or knowledge.  Shi2 識 refers to an awareness, a general recognition, and in a number of cases to familiarity through acquaintance.  The contrast with zhi1 知 "proper understanding" is very clear indeed.
3. WL claims that as a noun, shi2 識 means 知識、見解 in which meaning it is clearly distinct from zhi4 智 meaning "wisdom".  It is a moot point when exactly which zhi1 知 must be read zhi4, but the nominal usages of the word in which it does mean "understanding, level of understanding" are abundantly documented in SSC.
