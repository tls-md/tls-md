# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for weakness of any physical or abstract kind, and of anything including states, persons, and animals is ruò [[弱]] (ant. qiáng [[強]] "strong").
2. Léi [[羸]] (ant. jiàn [[健]] "strong and healthy") typically refers to physical weakness in humans.
3. Bào [[薄]] (ant. zhuàng [[壯]] "strong and vigorous") can refer to a low or weak intensity of something.
4. Cuì [[脆]] / [[膬]] (ant. jiān [[堅]] "strong and hard") refers to physical weakness as a result of brittleness and a propensity to break easily.
5. Chí [[弛]] (ant. jiān [[堅]] "strong and hard") refers to weakness as a result of abstract or physical slackening.
6. Shuāi [[衰]] (ant. shèng [[盛]] "strong and flourishing") refers to the process of weakening that attends any kind of decline.
7. Hào [[耗]] (ant. kāng [[康]] "increasingly vigorous and healthy") refers to the process of weakening that results from using up available resources.
8. Huǎ3n [[緩]] (ant. jié [[捷]] "nimble and vigorous in one's effort") is somewhat marginal in the group but can refer to habitual weakness of effort through slowness and lack of urgent and decisive action.
