# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[DYNAMIC/STATIC]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[LASTING/TRANSITORY]
[OBJECTIVE/SUBJECTIVE]
1. The current general word for appropriateness of any kind is yí 宜 (ant.* fáng 妨 "contravene standards, be inappropriate").
[GENERAL]
2. Kě 可 refers primarily to what is subjectively or interpersonally-subjectively i.e. socially acceptable.
[SUBJECTIVE]
3. Shì 是 (ant. fēi 非 "what does not deserve intellectual or moral approval") refers primarily to what is right and deserving of intellectual and/or moral approval.
[MORAL]
4. Shì 適 and dàng 當 (both ant. guāi 乖 "in conflict with certain prevailing circumstances") refer to what is objectively fitting in certain circumstances.
[OBJECTIVE], [TRANSITORY]
5. Shùn 順 (ant. nì 逆 "in conflict with the natural flow of events") refers to action that fits naturally and painlessly into a certain flow of events or into a certain constellation.
[DYNAMIC]
6. Qí 其 is a modal particle indicating weakly and abstractly that something should probably be done or happen. The word is thus marginal in this group. See SHOULD

## 
1. Acceptability or appropriateness may be primarily construed as a feature inherent in things as such (shì 是 ), or it may be construed as a feature attributed subjectively by a judge (kě 可 ).
2. Acceptability or appropriateness may be primarily construed as constituted by a voluntary act of acceptance (kě 可 ), or it may be primarily construed as constituted by an inherent feature of whatever is said to be acceptable (shì 是 ).
3. Acceptability or appropriateness may be construed as essentially context-free and permanent (shì 是 ), or it may be construed as primarily contextual and tied to a certain temporal or logical environment (kě 可 ).
4. When used in putative senses, the acceptance may be performative ( 洍 hereby approve �, kě 可 ), or it may be ordinarily descriptive ( 洍 consider as right � shì 是 ).
5. Some words primarily describe a physical fit (dāng 當 (See however dàng 當 TRUE), shì 適 ); other words are primarily abstract (yí 宜, shì 是, kě 可 ).
6. Some words are highly restricted and grammaticalised (qí 其 ) and refer to the appropriateness of actions. jiang
