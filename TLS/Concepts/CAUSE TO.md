# Definition
MOVE in SUCH a way that THEREFORE someone or something else CHANGES.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for causation is shǐ 使 which can refer to any form of bringing about a process or an action. See also COMMAND and SEND
2. Lìng 令, though primarily used for getting things done by ordering them to be done (see COMMAND) came to be used in Warring States times as a general equivalent for shǐ 使. NB: I have not so far found a neat distinction between these two common words in the group.
3. Qiǎn 遣, fā 發 all refer to causing things to happen by sending a person to bring them about. See also SEND
4. Zhì 致 refers to making others go further in doing something than they normally would.
