1. Ye4 液 is not a common word in pre-Buddhist Chinese, but the word does not only refer to "body fluids" in those few examples we have in the non-medical literature, it can refer to edible liquids as in CC 吸飛泉之微液兮 "I sipped the subtle liquor of the Flying Spring".  See also:
CC JIUSI 03:04; SBBY 554; Huang 294; Fu 256; tr. Hawkes 311;
吮玉液兮止渴， I sucked jade nectar to quench my thirst.
2. Zhi1 汁 does sometimes mean "drinkable juice", but the word is also very common in medical contexts, the difference between zhi1 汁 and ye4 液 in medical contexts remaining to be determined.
