聽，聞
1. WL rightly stresses the clear contrast between ti1ng 聽 "listen" and we2n 聞 "hear". But while WL notes elsewhere that ti1ng 聽 often is "listen to with approval, approve", there is no recognition of the corresponding tendency for we2n 聞 to mean "hear with approval, learn".  But a proper recognition of this is crucial in very many contexts.
