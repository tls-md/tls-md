# Definition
GARMENT USED in MOURNING.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general term for all forms of mourning dress, including the garments themselves and everything worn on them, was sāng [[喪]], and this term designates such articles of clothing insofar as they are used for their purpose.
2. Cuī [[衰]]／[[縗]] refers specifically to the garment worn in mourning.
3. Dié [[絰]] refers to the belt of coarse hemp worn in mourning.
4. Cuī dié [[衰絰]] refers in a general way to all the gear that makes up mourning dress, and quite frequently to the wearing of such gear, and I suspect that these terms would also refer to mourning dresses that are stored and not currently used in ritual contexts, but this needs to be investigated..
