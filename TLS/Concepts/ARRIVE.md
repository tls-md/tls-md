# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[ACTIVITY/STATE]
[COMMON/RARE]
[DIFFICULT/EASY]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[PROCESS/RESULT]
1. The general current word is zhì 至, and the word refers to the process of going somewhere with the final result (sometimes achieved with difficulty) of getting there.
[GENERAL]; [COMMON]
2. Dào 到 refers specifically to the reaching of a destination with no recognisable tendency to focus on the difficulty of getting there.
[LITERAL]; [RARE]
3. Jí 及 refers to the point of literal arrival, but the word is in practice often hard to distinguish in meaning from zhì 至.
[LITERAL]; [COMMON]
4. Zhì 致 "reach as far as" sometimes emphasises the difficulty of the task of reaching, but this word too is often hard to distinguish in meaning from 至 as defined above when it means "arrive".
[DIFFICULT!], [PROCESS!]
5. Tōng 通 emphasises the absence of impediments or hindrances in the passage towards a certain place and it refers to the general ability to get through.
[STATE]
6. Dá 達 is the result of tōng 通 "having unimpeded access to" and describes the successful arrival at a destination.
[RESULT]
7. Dǐ 抵 emphasises the arriving as the end of a complete itininerary with a beginning and an end.
[PROCESS]

1. WL claim that da4o 到 never has an omitted object. This is not borne out by the fact.
2. There is a wide range of syntactic and semantic distinctions between da4o 到 and zhi4 至 which WL fails to note.
