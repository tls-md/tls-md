# Definition
CAUSE TO BECOME FULL.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general and current word in this group is probably yíng [[盈]] (ant. xū [[虛]] "empty out") which refers to any filling up or filling in, abstract or concrete.
2. Chōng [[充]] refers to the concrete filling out completely of a container or a suitable empty space with (often desirable) physical substances.
3. Sài [[塞]] emphasises the nuance of filling in a space not necessarily designed to be filled in so as to block the free passage of other substances.
4. Mǎn [[滿]] is a word that was rather late to gain currency, replacing certain usages of yíng [[盈]], and it refers to the filling out of all of an empty space, with large amounts or large numbers of some specified kind of objects.
5. Tián [[填]] is originally to fill out something so as to make a level surface.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
充塞 is a current modern for filling something up.
充溢 refers to filling something so it flows over.
填滿 (lit) is to fill out or fill in a form or the like.
充斥 is to be filled with.
