# Definition
CONTINGENTLY come to EXPERIENCE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for having once encountered, actively tried or experienced something is cháng [[嘗]] and this word often feels more like an adverbial particle than a verb of experience.
2. Yù [[遇]] refers to having been exposed to something (often something positive) by coincidence.
3. Féng [[逢]] seems to be a dialect word synonymous with yù [[遇]], a word which it came to replace at later stages of the language as the standard word.
4. Zāo [[遭]] refers to running into something (often something negative).
5. Fàn [[犯]] refers to a deliberate encounter and to the facing up to what is encountered with energy and vigour.
6. Lín [[臨]] refers to facing something with calm dignity and self-control.
