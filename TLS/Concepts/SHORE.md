# Definition
SIDE of a RIVER, LAKE, OR SEA.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current and general word for a shore of any kind became àn [[岸]], which originally referred to a steep embankment.
2. Yá [[涯]] typically refers to a distant shore, and the word is often used metaphorically for "limit".
3. Bīn [[濱]] refers to the general area near a river or a lake, including the shoreline.
4. Hǔ [[滸]] refers to a the well-defined area very near a river or lake.
5. Pǔ [[浦]] refers to an estuary where small rivers meet larger ones, or where a river runs into a lake or the sea, and it is important that this term included the area covered by water.
6. Sì [[涘]] is a poetic and archaic general word for a river bank.
NB: As far as I can see there was no special word for the sea-shore.
