# Definition
MOST SMALL NUMBER.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word for one is yī [[一]].
2. Yī [[壹]] is primarily "to be concentrated", and the word is only rarely used for the adjectivally used number one, or nominally to refer to one thing. The convention of using yī [[壹]] as a complex way of writing a number is late, certainly post-Han.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
一個
# Ontology

## Hypernym
[[NUMBER]]
## Hyponym
[[ALONE]]

1. WL 1 claims that SHI 壹發 "shoot once" involves a late rewriting of the original yi1 fa1 一發 which is preserved in a Tang stone version of the text.  In fact, the meaning "once" for the graph yi1 壹 is perfectly standard in pre-Han times, although also the graph yi1 一 is also perfectly acceptable in this meaning.  See ONCE.
2.  As a survey of the attested meanings of yi1 壹 shows, this graph can be used for a wide range of the idiomatic meanings of yi1 一 and certainly not only for "to concentrate", as suggested in WL 1.
