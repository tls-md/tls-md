# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. It is very difficult to identify a standard classical Chinese keyword that corresponds to the notion of an intellectual problem or issue. The closest one can come is probably duān 端 "topic".
2. Wèn nàn 問難 refers to a problem raised.
3. Wèn 問 may refer not only to the raising of a topic for discussion.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
問題 is the standard modern word for a problem of any kind.
疑問 focusses on the doubts attached to a problematic intellectual question raised.
疑難 refers to a doubtful point or intellectual difficulty.
疑案 refers in a rather formal way to some typically official issue.
疑竇 refers to a problem or issue as a source for serious suspicion.
疑團 identifies a whole area of problematic confusion.
疑雲 focusses in a figurative way on the doubtfulness surrounding a problem.
疑點 focusses precisely on a particular individual problematic point.
疑義 focusses in a literary way on a doubtful point, typically a point of interpretation.
謎 may refer hyperbolically to an insoluble problem.
悶葫蘆 is a figurative highly colloquial term for a puzzle.
