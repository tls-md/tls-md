# Definition
DISTRESSED BECAUSE of NEAR:recent PAST INTENSIVE EFFORT.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general purpose word for communal exhaustion is pì [[罷]] (ant. zhuàng [[壯]] "in strong shape"); the general word for the state of exhaustion of an individual is juàn [[倦]]. [[不倦]] refers to tireless activity, [[不饜]] refers to tireless receptivity. See DISSATISFIED.
2. Pí [[疲]] and bèi [[憊]] typically refer to a relatively mild state of exhaustion.
3. Bì [[弊]] refers to a desperate state of exhaustion.
4. Láo [[勞]] refers to the state of exhaustion after extended lasting effort.
5. Dān [[殫]] refers not so much to the subjective feeling of exhaustion as to the objective inability to continue an activity for lack of further energy.
6. Qú [[劬]], a very poetic word, and the less poetic qín [[勤]], focus on the effort that brings about tiredness.
7. Cuì [[瘁]] is a poetic word referring to weariness.
8. Qiáo cuì [[憔悴]] refers to a weariness born of exhaustion.
9. Láo [[老]] refers specifically to exhaustion of soldiers.
10. Yàn [[厭]] refers specifically to being tired of, and thus fed up with something.

TIRED

fessus refers also to a subjective state of exhaustion induced by an exhausting effort, but is perhaps a somewhat stronger word to use.
lassus refers to an objective and physical state of exhaustion, like lassatus.

苶，薾，芡
These are quite separate words, of course. That 芡 can be used for 苶 is not documented under 芡, nor is it in HYDCD, but it may be true all the same as a scribal error.
