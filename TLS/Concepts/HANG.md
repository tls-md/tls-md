2. Chuí [[垂]] refers to the whole structure that dangles from a high object. Thus, for example, a rope is said to chuí [[垂]] from a tree, but an object will be said to xuán [[懸]] "be suspended" on that rope.
3. Guà [[掛]] is a rare word referring to the act of hanging something up, typically for visibility.
