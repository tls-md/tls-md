# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general current word for a friend is yǒu [[友]] (ant. dí [[敵]] "enemy"), and the specific nuance indicated by this word is that of a commonality of feelings and interests, although it must be noted that the etymological link of the word is with the notion of "help", and in pre-SHI times the word tended to refer to cooperating associates rather than friends.
2. Péng [[朋]] typically refers to a person of similar educational background and a similar political or social agenda.
3. Dǎng [[黨]] refers to group of péng [[朋]] pursuing a common aim, and the word is normally derogatory in meaning.
4. Bàn [[伴]] and lu# [[侶]] refer to a companion during a specified period of time.
5. Pǐ [[匹]] and chóu [[儔]] refer to a person of similar professional or social background who for this reason has connections with one.
6. Jiù [[舊]], gù rén [[故人]], gù zhī [[故知]], and jiù gù [[舊故]] (all ant. shēng rén [[生人]] "stranger") refer to old acquaintances linked together by common experiences in the distant past.
7. Zhī yīn [[知音]] refers to person who has a proper sense for the special qualities of another in such a way that he is linked to him by deep bonds of spiritual friendship.
8. Hǎo [[好]] often refers to relations of friendship and good-will between states and communities, but also between individuals.
