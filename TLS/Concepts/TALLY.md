# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
All these words refer to documents which officially or formally convey authority or are symbols of a contractual relationship.
1. The fú 符 tally always has two "halves" only.
2. The jié 節 is originally made of bamboo and can be divided into one or more "halves" that have to fit together to count as tallies.
3. The zhuàn 傳 is a tally with an inscription specifying what the authority conveyed is.
4. Quàn 券 and the somewhat more archaic qì 契 refers to the physical object which constitutes the written version of a contract or an agreement.
