## Old Chinese Criteria
[ADNOMINAL/ADVERBIAL]
[ARCHAIC/CURRENT]
[COLLECTIVE/INDIVIDUAL]
[[COMMON/RARE]]
[OBJECT-BINDING/SUBJECT-BINDING]
1. Jiē [[皆]] the most common and general colourless subject qunatifier which is also used, occasionally as an object quantifier.
SUBJECT-BINDING!; [padV]
2.Jìn [[盡]] is a universal object quantifier which indicates that the action the transitive verb it precedes applies to the whole lot of the objects of that verb indiscriminately.
[OBJECT-BINDING!], [COLLECTIVE]; [vadVt]
3. Gè [[各]] quantifies by emphasising the separate features of each item quantified over.
[INDIVIDUAL], [SUBJECT-BINDING]; [n+Vt]
4. Jiān [[兼]] is an object quantifier which says that the transitive verb it precedes applies to each of the objects in its own right.
[OBJECT-BINDING], [INDIVIDUAL]; [vadVt]
5. Qún [[群]] is a quantifier which indicates that the whole of the flock or group of items designated by the noun it precedes are referred to
[COLLECTIVE]; [nadN]
6. Zhū [[諸]] is an adjectival quantifier which indicates that the whole group of the things indicated by the noun it precedes is referred to.
[COLLECTIVE]; [padN]
7. Zhòng [[眾]] is an adnominal quantififier which says that the whole of the group of things designated by the noun it precedes are intended.
[COLLECTIVE]; [nadN]
8. Fán [[凡]] characterises a topic adnominally as forming the general subject or topic in a non-narrative statement of principle. The current gloss "in general" is misleading because it wrongly suggests that there are exceptions, and because it does not specify the non-narrative "theoretical" nature of the statements introduced by the word. "In principle" is much to be preferred.
[SPECIFIC]; [vadN[TOPIC]]
9. Jù [[俱]] / [[具]] is a collective subject quantifier which says that all the subjects are equally and together characterised by what is in the predicate.
[SUBJECT-BINDING]; [vadV]
10. Fàn [[氾]] quantifies generally over all objects of the verb it precedes.
[COLLECTIVE], [OBJECT-BINDING]; [vadVt]
11. Fàn [[汎]] says that a verb has a whole range of objects, indiscriminately, and without reference to their specific character.
[COLLECTIVE], [OBJECT-BINDING]; [padVt]
12. Měi [[每]] mostly adnominal and emphasises that a each and every new item quantified over is separately intended.
[INDIVIDUAL]; [padN]
13. Jūn [[均]] / [[鈞]] expresses universal quantification over all subjects equally, without any difference.
[INDIVIDUAL], [SUBJECT-BINDING]; [vadN]
14. Zhōu [[周]] is a rare object quantifier claiming that all the objects of a verb are intended, without exception.
[COLLECTIVE], [OBJECT-BINDING]; [vadVt]
15. Xī [[悉]] mass object qunatifier which says that the transitive verb it precedes applies to the whole of the objects indiscriminately.
[COLLECTIVE], [OBJECT-BINDING]; [vadVt]
16. Xián [[咸]] is an archaic subject quantifier which came to new life in Han times.
[INDIVIDUAL], [SUBJECT-BINDING!]; [vadV]
17. Bì [[畢]] a subject quantifier which says that the predicate applies to all subjects.
[ADVERBIAL]; [SUBJECT-BINDING]; [RARE]
18. Jǔ [[舉]] is an adjectival quantifier of limited idiomatic use indicating that all the things in a certain area are referred to.
[ADNOMINAL]; [COLLECTIVE]
19. Wú bù [[無不]] is a neutral subject and object quantifier.
20. Mò bù [[莫不]] is a neutral subject quantifier.
[PREVERBAL]; [SUBJECT-BINDING]
21. Sì hǎi [[四海]] sometimes refers generally to all inhabitants of the inhabited world, like tiān xià [[天下]], and these are marginal in this group.
[NOMINAL]; [COLLECTIVE]

## 
1. Some quantifiers jìn 盡, jiān 兼 have the object as their scope, others have the subject as their scope, and others may refer to either subject or object.
2. Some quantifiers typically quantify over individualised items gè 各, others over groups or masses jìn 盡.
3. Some quantifiers are pre-nominal in function standing before the noun that is their scope zhū 諸, qún 群, others are pre-verbal and adverbial, standing before the verb-phrase.
4. Jiān 兼 is an object quantifier which says that the transitive verb it precedes applies to each of the objects in its own right.
>>ADVERBAL; OBJECT-BINDING, INDIVIDUAL
5. Fán 凡 "generally" and fán 凡 "altogether" are marginal in this group because they do not quantify over any objects.
NP: a whole range of nouns can be used to refer to all things referred to by these nouns when they are used in "adverbial" position. Rì 日 "every day", yuè 月 "every month"; suì 歲 "every year"; zhōu 州 "each province"; jùn 郡 "every commandery"; xiàn 縣 "every district"; jiā 家 "every clan".
6. Jù 俱 quantifies over subjects, jù 具 typically means "all of the objects", although there is room for inaccuracies in orthography, and there often are variants in different editions.
7. Jiē 偕, when used as a quantifier, adds the notion of contemporaneity to that of universal quantification.

OMNE, TOTUS
402. Vid. Servium, in illud I Aen.: Tota armenta sequuntur.
]
402. Inter Omne et totum. Omne ad multitudinem et ad numerum pertinet: [ Al. add. ut omnis] ad numerum, ut omnes homines; ad multitudinem, ut omnis familia, omnis exercitus, omne pecus dicimus. Totum vero ad magnitudinem pertinet, ut totum corpus, tota terra, totum coelum. Ergo totus homo, si ad corpus referamus; omnis homo, si de universis. Proinde omne in diversis partibus ponitur, totum autem sine partibus debet esse.

1. The observation that jie1 皆 and jie1 偕 are synonymous is striking.  The fact is that jie1 皆 generally means "all subjects, without exception" whereas jie1 偕 is originally a verb, and when used as an adverbial quantifier means "all subjects at the same time, all subjects together".
