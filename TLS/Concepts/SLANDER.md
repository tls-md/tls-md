3. Bàng [[謗]] "vilify a person" (ant. chēng [[稱]] "praise") refers to public serious criticism, sometimes coming close to public abuse; increasingly, the word tended to refer to unjustified such accusations, i.e. slander, but the word is also used for justified serious criticism in public.

7. Wū [[誣]] (ant. zàn [[贊]] "praise justly") refers specifically to unjustified slander.
8. Shàn [[訕]] (ant. sòng [[頌]] "sing the praises of") adds an element of ridicule to that of speaking ill of a person.

誹，謗，譏
1. WL claims that ba4ng 謗 and fe3i 誹are both used for justified criticism in early texts, and that from Han times onwards the words tend to be used less and less for criticism and more and more for unwarranted criticism or slander.  In fact, fe3i ba4ng 誹謗 is a current word for slander, but the two words differ considerably. Fe3i 誹 refers to censure or criticism and has yu4 譽 "give praise to" as a very high frequency  regular antonym.  Ba4ng 謗 never has an antonym yu4 譽, and the word does very often refer to unwarranted slander and vilification rather than criticism. Thus fe3i 誹 "popular censure, criticism" is significantly absent in CC, where ba4ng 謗 "malicious slander" is ubiquitous.  I have not found a single instance where fe3i 誹 refers unambiguously to malicious slander.
2. Moreover, WL claims that ba4ng 謗 is public whereas fe3i 誹 is popular but private and mumbling. The evidence for this is unclear.  The contrast between ba4ng 謗 involving malice and fe3i 誹 focussing primarily on disapproval fe1i 非 as such is much clearer.
