# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general current word for leniency and forgiveness is yòu [[宥]] (ant. kè [[刻]] "strict and ruthless").
2. Kuān [[寬]] (ant. kè [[刻]] "ruthless strictness") refers to a general attitude of mind which inclines one to pardon others and to show forgiveness.
3. Róng [[容]] is an individual act of forgiveness or pardoning vis-a-vis a person who is guilty of something or might be blamed for something.
4. Shì [[釋]] refers to a personal act of forgiveness directed at a certain person, and in regard of a certain action.
5. Shù [[恕]] (ant.* chóu [[仇]] "take a strict hostile attitude to") refers to acts of forgiveness as well as an understanding attitude which involves forgiveness as a virtue.
6. Shè [[赦]] refers more properly to the formal act of pardoning or acquiting in court, but the word is also commonly used for mental acts of non-legal social forgiveness.
7. Shì [[貰]] is too rare to be very sure of it, but the word is used to refer to forgiveness as something psychological rather than as a social act merely promising non-punishment.

Brilliant brief survey by Barbare Cassin herself, contrasting the Greek notion of common knowledge establishing a common "us" through the declaration of sympathetic understanding, versus the hierarchical disregarding/ignoring (ignosco), remission of what is owed (pardonare). It was the latter paradigm which came to dominate in Western Europe.
