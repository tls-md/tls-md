後聖有作， When later there arose sages,
然後修火之利， only from then on [people] applied the advantage of fire.
範金, They cast bronze [tools]
冶金為器用刑範也
合土， and moulded earthen [ware].
合和以作瓦物
以為宮室戶牖； Thus, they made platforms and pavilions, mansions and houses [with] doors and windows.
以炮以燔， And so they grilled, they broiled,
毛曰炮加火曰燔也
以烹以炙， they cooked and they roasted;
煮之曰烹炮之曰炙
以為醴酪； so they made sweet and sour wine.
醴醴酒酪漿酢
