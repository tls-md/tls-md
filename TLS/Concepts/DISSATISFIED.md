# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. A general word for dissatisfaction of any kind, and for any reason, is hèn [[恨]] (ant. qiè [[慊]] / [[愜]] "be satisfied"), but this word is rare in ancient times, the current way of expressing this idea is to use bù yuè [[不悅]]／[[說]].
2. Yàn [[厭]] / [[饜]] typically refers to dissatisfaction as a result of overexposure to something.
3. Hàn [[憾]] refers to a nagging kind of lingering grievance or personal dissatisfaction.
4. Bìng [[病]] refers to dissatisfaction as a result of a considered judgment that something is unreasonable or not right.
NB: There are a number of poetic words for dissatisfaction, notably in CHUCI, which are hard to define in terms to synonym group contrasts.
