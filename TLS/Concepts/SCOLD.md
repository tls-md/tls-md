# Definition
BLAME someone ADDRESSING him/her USING VIOLENT WORDS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for scolding someone or swearing at someone is lì 詈 (ant. yú 諛 "speak to in an obsequious way").
2. Mà 罵 (ant. chǎn 諂 "speak to in a flattering way") refers to venting one's anger with someone through language, but without necessarily being in the immediate physical vicinity of the object of one's abuse.
3. Chì 叱 and the hē 呵 are colloquial words for swearing or venting one's anger to the face of the object of one's abuse.
4. Dǐ 詆 (ant. sòng 頌 "sing the praises of") focusses not so much on the venting of anger but on the function of insulting and offending the person scolded.
5. Gòu 詬 (ant. zàn 讚 "praise publicly") adds to the swearing and scolding strong overtones of public insult.
