# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[[BASIC/MARGINAL]]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIED]
[[CURRENT/RARE]]
1. The standard way of expression the idea of AS SOON AS is by preverbal yī [[一]].
[GENERAL]; [[COMMON]]
2. Jīn [[今]] "but now as soon as" is perhaps more hypothetically dramatising than yī [[一]], and the usage of this word in the meaning "as soon as" is rare.
[ADVERSATIVE]; [[MARGINAL]], [[RARE]]
3. Chū [[初]] refers to the initial stage where something is the case and the word is often best translated as "just", but sometimes it is conveniently rendered as "as soon as".
[[MARGINAL]], [[RARE]]
