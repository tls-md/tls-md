# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The dominant quite general word is xiǎo 小 (ant. dà 大 "big"), and this word refers to both physical size and abstract importance.
2. Miǎo 眇 / 渺 and mǐ 靡 (ant. páng 龐 "big") refers to extremely small size of something.
3. Xì 細 (ant. jù 巨 "enormous") is sometimes used to refer to something being small or of slight importance. See TENUOUS
NB: ǎi 矮 "not tall, of slight height, of low build" is post-Buddhist late colloquial.
