2. Ér [[兒]] refers to children of fairly young age.
3. Tóng [[童]] refers to a person as a young child without focusing on whose child it is and the word is often used in compounds.

Xiǎo zǐ [[小子]] is often used for small children but can also refer to people lower in hierachy as for example the disciples of a master (often when the master is addressing them); in addition it is sometimes used by the ruler (when mourning for his parents) and by high officers as humble first person pronoun.
8. Rǔ zǐ [[孺子]] can refer to very young children, but the word can also refer more generally to youths, especially girls.
