肉，肌
1. WL claims that ro4u 肉 refers to the flesh of animals, while ji1 肌 refers to the flesh of men.  This is a misunderstanding.  Re2n ro4u 人肉 is common in the literature.  The salient feature in ro4u 肉 is not whose flesh it is, but whether this flesh is regarded under the aspect of edibility:  子肉也。我肉也。 is a famous statement by people who are about to eat each other.  WL quotes Dua4n Yu4ca2i: 人曰肌，鳥獸曰肉, but whereas he was on the right track, he has not got things straight. And WL's repeated emphatic statement: 漢以後“肉”也可用於人 is manifestly wrong.
2. Ji1 肌 cannot be used for the meat of animals, but the word does get used to refer to the flesh of gourds and the like, and the word is also commonly used to refer to the skin only.  The Tang reference for this usage in WL 989 is 1000 years too late.
