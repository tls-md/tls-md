## Old Chinese Criteria

2. Bó [[博]] (ant. yuē [[約]] "confined") is primarily metaphorical in application, and its concrete senses applied to physical objects are derived senses of the word only.
3. Kuàng [[曠]] adds to the feature of broadness and wide space that of emptiness.
4. Kuò [[闊]] (ant. xiá [[狹]] "narrow") adds to the concept of broadness of spatial extent that of remote distance, and the word was late to enter the pre-Buddhist language.
5. Kuān [[寬]] (ant. zhǎi [[窄]] "narrow") is recorded as meaning "broad" in SHUOWEN and is so used in HOUHANSHU, but the word was predominantly used in metaphorical senses like "broad-minded, forgiving, not strict", and related to huì [[惠]] "generous".
