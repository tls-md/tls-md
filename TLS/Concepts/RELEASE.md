# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general word for setting an animal or a person free is shì [[釋]] (ant. shōu [[收]] "hold prisoner").
2. Zòng [[縱]] (ant. yuē [[約]] "restrain") is to give free reins to someone or something that is under constraint with the expectation that this feedom will be used freely and enthusiastically.
3. Sì [[肆]] (ant. jié [[節]] "restrain, moderate") refers to giving free rein to psychological tendencies and the like, thus going beyond what are natural societal expectations.
4. Chū [[出]] (ant. liú [[留]] "keep in retention") is a colourless term referring to letting someone out of an enclosure, typically prison.
5. Miǎn [[免]] (ant. jiū [[究]] "hold definitely responsible for crimes") refers specifically to an act of mercy involving a decision to set someone free who is available for criminal prosecution for a crime assumed committed.
6. Fàng [[放]] (ant. liǎn [[斂]] "exert a moderating influence on") refers to a removal of constraints on animals or persons, causing these to follow their natural instincts.
