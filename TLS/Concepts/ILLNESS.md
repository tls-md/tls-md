# Definition
TYPICALLY TEMPORARY DEFECT of the BODY OR MIND of HUMANS OR of the BODY of ANIMALS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. From Warring States onwards the most current general word for illness was bìng 病, but in earlier times the word referred even more generally to troubles and difficulties of many kinds. This archaic usage did continue into later usage. When used specifically, bìng 病 refers to a lasting long-term medical condition. Interestingly, mental/emotional conditions tend to be bìng 病, perhaps because they are taken to be lasting and not acute.
2. Jí 疾 is the oldest general word for illness, from OBI times onwards, and often this word continues to be used in this generalised way. But sometimes the word comes to refer more specifically to an acute short-term medical condition, adjectivally in jí bìng 疾病, and especially a change in medical condition, that can be very serious but is not normally construed as chronic. (Seasonal epidemiological conditions are also jí 疾.)
3. Yàng 恙 is largely restricted to the common idiomatic formula wú yàng 無恙 "be in good health" and sometimes yǒu yàng 有恙 "have medical problems".
4. Lì 癘 often refers to pest and the like, and comes to refer to any very serious disease. For specific meanings see also ILLNESSES.

疾，病
1. WL 二字同義. WL rightly rejects the traditional opinion that bi4ng 病 is more serious than ji2 疾 by pointing out that ji2 疾 can certainly be mortal.  In fact, the main difference is that bi4ng 病 primarily refers to a lasting medical condition, whereas ji2 疾 refers to an acute medical condition. 
Now it is quite true that there are instances where the two words seem to be used interchangeably, as in
HF 22.21:01; jishi 435; jiaozhu 243f; shiping 757
張譴相韓， Zha1ng Qia3n was prime minister in Ha2n.
病將死。 He was ill and was about to die.
公乘無正懷三十金 Go1ngche2ng Wu2zhe4ng took along thirty cash
   而問其疾。 and paid him a visit on account of his current state of sickness.
