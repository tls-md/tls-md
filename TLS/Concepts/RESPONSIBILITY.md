Gernet deals with the Tang Code, and finds that it makes ample reference to the intentionality of action, and to personal responsibility as relevant factors in Tang legal practice.  

There is no reference to questions of terminology.  Thus whether or not Tang China had a notion of psychological moral responsibility remains an open question.  It is a question that deserves careful historical analysis.
