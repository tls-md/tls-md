# Criteria and general notes

1. The general word for a servant is chén 臣. But the meaning of this term is typically general. See SUBJECT.
2. Shì 仕 is a permanent employee of some status, normally a literate person.
3. Lì 吏 is an executive official.
4. Huàn 宦 refers at an early stage to the person in charge of the servant corps in a household; in imperial times the word came to refer to the head of the imperial household. In later Han times the word came to refer to eunuchs.
5. Zǎi 宰 refers to the position of the head of a senior household in early times, in charge of the various huàn 宦. The title was also used in the imperial hierarchy as a vague bureaucratic title, translatable perhaps as "political secretary".
