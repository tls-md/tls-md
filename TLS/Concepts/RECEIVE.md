# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word is shòu 受 (ant. jù 拒 "refuse to accept"; ant.* yǔ 與 "give"), which can refer to any concrete or abstract form of receiving or being exposed to.
2. Chéng 承 (ant.* zèng 贈 "present formally") refers to the polite act of receiving something as a gift.
3. Fèng 奉 and bǐng 稟 (ant.* cì 賜 "present formally to inferiors") refers to the polite act of receiving any concrete or abstract thing (including orders and the like) from a superior.
4. Měng 蒙 is to be on the receiving end of a process, and the word hardly ever takes concrete objects.
5. Nà 納 focusses concretely on the receiving something from the outside into some inside.
6. Shōu 收 refers specifically to receiving what is due to one.
