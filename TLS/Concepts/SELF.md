PERSON that is NOT OTHER.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general-use word referring to oneself is jǐ [[己]], and this word refers regularly to the highest subject in the whole sentence in which it occurs. In reflexivising object position of a main verb it serves as a "heavy" reflexive pronoun like German "sich selbst", Latin se ipsum.
2. Zì [[自]] is preverbal and typically makes any transitive verb it precedes reflexive, when another object is present it refers to an action being performed not by any other subject than the grammatical subject. As a reflexivising pronoun often glossable as [[自己把自己]] the pronoun has the double function of emphatic subject AND identical object.
3. Shēn [[身]] typically refers to the subject in a contrastive way, and the word is often hard to distinguish from the nominal concept of a PERSON. Adverbially, the word is different from PERSONALLY in that it does not connote distinction in the agent.
4. Gōng [[躬]] is a fairly rare archaic and idiomatically restricted word referrring to the agent himself.
