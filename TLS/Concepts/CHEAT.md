# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard common word for cheating is qī [[欺]] (ant. chéng [[誠]] ) and it refers to any deliberate act of deception, self-interested or not, even occasionally self-deception.
2. Zhà [[詐]] (ant. què [[愨]] "honest") is a fraudulent act of cheating designed to harm the interests of others.
3. Wěi [[偽]] (ant. zhēn [[真]] "true, unfaked") is dissumulation and pretense, not necessarily with an intent to harm others.
4. Guǐ [[詭]] and jué [[譎]] (all ant. zhèng [[正]] "straight and not deceitful") are dishonesty with an intent to deceive and harm others.
5. Wū [[誣]] is to deliberately mislead someone through lying.
6. Dàn [[誕]] is to deceive through boastful exaggeration. See EXAGGERATE
7. Mán [[謾]] refers primarily to the speaking without being serious about what one says.
NB: There is an extraordinary wealth of rare vocabulary of possibly colloquial origin within this field.
