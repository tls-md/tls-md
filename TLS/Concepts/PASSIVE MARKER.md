2. Passives in wéi 為 "be the object of" abstractly indicates that the verb it modifies is neutrally passive.
3. Passives in bèi 被 "suffer" typically refers to the suffering of something undesirable.
4. Passives in qǔ 取 "bring upon onesel" typically refers to the suffering of something undesirable by one's own fault.
5. Passives in zāo 遭 "come upon" and yù 遇 "run into" refer to running into what tend to be undesirable situations one is exposed to.

For passives in yú 於 see the entry under SUFFER.<br></div><br>NB: Note that the notion of the passive is notoriously hard to define for a language like classical Chinese. What some grammarians view as passive constructions will be construed by others as periphrastic ways of expressing with various transitive verbs what other other languages express with passive forms.
