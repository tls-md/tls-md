# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general word referring to the location of something is chù 處 which may refer to the location in which a thing happens to be at some point in time, or to the place where something belongs, and the word refers to both abstract and concrete spatial location.
2. Suǒ 所 "proper place", when used pregnantly on its own, refers to the place where a thing basically belongs, where someone lives, and where something should be. This word was the most common word for a place in early literature. Quite frequently, the word refers not just to a place, but particularly to a building in a place.
3. Dì 地 is primarily a territory, and only by occasional extension the abstract location of something.
4. W4èi 位 sometimes comes to refer to the position in a terrain.
5. Chǎng 場 refers specifically to the location for certain activities like threshing etc.
