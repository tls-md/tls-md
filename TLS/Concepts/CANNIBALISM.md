KEY IDEA
The ritual consumption of humans by humans is archaeologically well documented at an early stage. Among mammals, man seems to be the only creature which developed this idea, and indeed not only kill each other on a vast scale but also to engage in ritual cannibalism.
LESTRINGANT 1997 the wildly distorting literary "reception history" of this phenomenon. PETTERSSON 1999 provides a useful sourcebook on Chinese official evidence. KEY RAY CHONG is the standard Chinese reference. ZHENG YI details the crucial phenomenon of modern political cannibalism.
