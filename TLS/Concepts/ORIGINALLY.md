# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word is běn [[本]] (ant. jìng [[竟]] "in the end") and refers to the crucial and formative early stage in any development.
2. Chū [[初]] (ant. jīn [[今]] "nowadays") is purely chronological and does not imply any formative influence of the beginning stage.
3. Shǐ [[始]] "originally" (ant. zhōng [[終]] "in the end") does imply a strict continuity of development from the beginnings to later stages.
4. Sù [[素]] "primordially" (ant. jīn [[今]] "nowadays") emphasises the primordial and essential purity of the earliest phase of something.
