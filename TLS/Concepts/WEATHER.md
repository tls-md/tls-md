# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
There is no commonly used general concept for the weather in pre-Buddhist Chinese. The closest we come is perhaps qì [[氣]] as in ZUO [[天有六氣]], but consider the whole passage:
[[天有六氣]]， (In the same way) there are six heavenly influences,
[[降生五味]]， which descend and produce the five tastes,
[[發為五色]]， go forth in the five colours,
[[徵為五聲]]。 and are verified in the five notes;
[[淫生六疾]]。 but when they are in excess, they produce the six diseases.
[[六氣曰陰]]、[[陽]]、[[風]]、[[雨]]、[[晦]]、[[明也]]， Those six influences are denominated the yin, the yang, wind, rain, obscurity, and brightness.
[[分為四時]]， In their separation, they form the four seasons;
[[序為五節]]， in their order, they form the five (elementary) terms.
[[過則為菑]]： When any of them is in excess, there ensues calamity.
[[陰淫寒疾]]， An excess of the yin leads to diseases of the cold;
[[陽淫熱疾]]， of the yang, to diseases of heat;
[[風淫末疾]]， of wind, to diseases of the extremities;
[[雨淫腹疾]]， of rain, to diseases of the belly;
[[晦淫惑疾]]， of obscurity, to diseases of delusion;
[[明淫心疾]]。 of brightness to diseases of the mind.
