# Definition
TIME of MIDDLE of the DAY.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word for the period around the middle of the day is rì zhōng 日中, and this construction hovers interestingly between the sentential original meaning "the sun reaches the highest point" and the idiomatic nominal meaning "noon", "at noon", thus jí rì zhōng 及日中 can be read as "when the sun reached the highest point" or "when it got to the point in time of noon"
NB: Shǎng 晌 is a fairly rare popular word for lunchtime that is not used before Ming times.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
中午
正午
午
晌午
亭午
