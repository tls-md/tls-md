# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[AD-HOC/SYSTEMATIC]
[AIMLESS/PURPOSEFUL]
[ARTIFICIAL/NATURAL]
[BASE/NOBLE]
[BASIC/MARGINAL]
[COMMENDATORY/DEROGATORY]
[CONATIVE/PERFECTIVE]
[DELIBERATE/INVOLUNTARY]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[HABITUAL/OCCASIONAL]
[HUMBLE/NOBLE]
[PHYSICAL/MENTAL]
[PRESCRIBED/SPONTANEOUS]
[PRIVATE/PUBLIC]
[RESPONSIBLE/UNACCOUNTABLE]
1. The current general word for any deliberate behaviour one may be held morally and/or administratively responsible for is xíng [[行]] (ant. zhǐ [[止]] "decide not to take action"), and this conduct is typically one engaged in on someone else's behalf.
[COMMENDATORY!], [GENERAL], [HABITUAL], [PHYSICAL], [RESPONSIBLE]
2. Wéi [[為]] (ant. wú wéi [[無為]] "not engage in purposeful and result-orientated self-assertive action") focusses not on the act itself but primarily on the results achieved or aimed for.
[OCCASIONAL], [PURPOSEFUL]
3. Jū [[居]], when used in this meaning, focusses not on the results of one's actions, or on the effect of one's actions on others, but on the moral character of one's behaviour as such.
[HABITUAL], [RESPONSIBLE], [SYSTEMATIC]
4. Shì [[事]] (ant.* xián [[閒]] "take it easy") primarily focusses on action as part of the fulfilment of a duty imposed by one's station in life or a task one has set oneself.
[PRESCRIBED], [PUBLIC!], [RESPONSIBLE]
5. Gōng [[躬]] (ant.* shǐ rén [[使人]] "get others to...") focusses on a person of considerable social status engaging personally in a (typically public) action. See SELF.
[MARGINAL], [NOBLE], [OCCASIONAL], [PUBLIC!]
6. Wěi [[偽]] (ant. tiān [[天]] "natural") refers to artificial or faked human action. See PRETEND.
[ARTIFICIAL], [DEROGATORY!]
7. Dòng [[動]] (ant. jìng [[靜]] "decide to remain inactive") typically refers to spontaneous purposeful action and focusses almost philosophically on the autonomous decision of the agent to act.
[OCCASIONAL], [DELIBERATE]
8. Zuò [[作]] (ant. xí [[息]] "fail to take the initiative, fail to become active") refers to the taking of an initiative for an action which would not have occurred without such a deliberate initiative, and the word is naturally associated with the notion of creativity.
SPONTANEOUS, OCCASIONAL, PERFECTIVE
9. Jǔ [[舉]] refers specifically to the undertaking of a well-considered major act, particularly as part of a political strategy.
[DELIBERATE], [PURPOSEFUL], [RESPONSIBLE]
NB: Fēng [[風]] refers rather generally and abstractly to a person's or a group's way or pattern of behaviour, and the word is usually used as a noun. See CUSTOM
10. Jiā [[加]] typically refers to action insofar as it affects others.
11. Xí [[習]] refers to the habitual repeated practice of something in order to achieve proficiency in the kind of action concerned.
## Modern Chinese Criteria

行事 (lit) refers to the conduct of affairs.
表現 refers specifically to one's appearance as created through behaviour.

## 
1. The general term for action that humans are conceived as morally responsible for is xíng 行. The other common words jǔ 舉 and wéi [[為]] focus not on the moral quality of what is done but on the result.
2. Some action words refer predominantly to commendable actions (xíng 行 ), others predominantly in a derogatory way to misdeeds (zuò 作 (but NB that when zuò 作 means "create" the word has no negative connotations)).
3. Some action words refer to official activities that are part of one's regular standard duties (cóng 從, zhī 知 ), others refer predominantly to special tasks and specific official activities undertaken in this connection (shì 事 ); others are neutral in this respect (wéi [[為]] ).
4. Some actions are construed as being based on the actor's own intitiative (dòng 動 ) or artifice (wěi 偽 ).
5. Some action words focus on the immediate personal involvement of the actor who is not delegating the execution of an act to others (gōng 躬 ).
