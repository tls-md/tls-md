# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[GRAMMATICALISED/LEXICAL]
1. The general word is zài [[在]] (ant. wáng [[亡]] "be not present, be absent") which refers to any presence of anything in anything.
[GENERAL]
2. Chù [[處]] is often non-literally spatial and refers to occupancy of a well-defined place in society, but has a wide range of associated meanings and is very common.
[ABSTRACT!]
3. Yú [[於]] is grammaticalised as a preposition but can come to function as a main verb "be in", and this verbal use may perhaps be taken to be etymologically primary.
[GRAMMATICALISED]
4. Jū [[居]] is orginally "to dwell at home" and sometimes comes to mean more generally "be in". See BE AT HOME
[MARGINAL]; [[RARE]]
5. Lu# [[履]] "tread on" occasionally refers to being in a certain position.
