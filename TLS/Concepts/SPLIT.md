# Definition
CUT QUICKLY so as to DIVIDE into TWO.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general word referring to the action of splitting things into several parts is pǒu 剖, and when the dividing is distinctly into two parts the current word is pàn 判 (ant.** bìng 併 "fit together").
2. Pī 劈 / 辟 as well as the archaic s � 1 斯 refer to a violent act of cleaving or hacking to pieces.
3. Liè 裂 refers to any process which results in the cleaving of an object and focusses on that result rather than the process itself.
4.. Pī 披 is to split open without necessarily dividing the object of splitting into two separate parts.
5. Xī 析 is a mild act of dividing a thing, typically into its proper constituent parts, or separating off constituent parts (often for analysis).
