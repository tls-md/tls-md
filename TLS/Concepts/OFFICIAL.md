# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Officials are referred to as shì [[士]] and daì fū [[大夫]]. The word shì [[士]] can also include daì fū [[大夫]], therefore the term is often used for a whole body of officials.
2. Dà fū [[大夫]] "notables" is a general formal term for high officials.
3. Lì [[吏]] refers to officials in charge of concrete practical matters, often policing and the like.
4. Gōng [[工]] can be used as a general term for clerks.
5. Yǒu sī [[有司]] can refer to a person in charge of an office.
6. Guān [[官]] refers quite generally to the persons in charge of an office.
7. Shì zhě [[仕者]] refers to any person in public employment of any kind.
8. Lǎo [[老]] originally politely referred to higher officials (>gōng [[公]], >qīng [[卿]], >dài fū [[大夫]] ), therefore it came to be used as a general term referring to high officials.
9. Yuán [[員]] originally refers to officials as counted units, and the word came to be used as a general term for officials.
