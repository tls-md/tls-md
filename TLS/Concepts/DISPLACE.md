# Definition
CAUSE to MOVE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard very general word for making something move or displacing something is dòng [[動]], and there is no general suggestion that the thing moved comes to rest anywhere.
2. Yí [[移]] refers to dislocating anything to a new location where it comes to remain for some shorter or longer time.
3. Xǐ [[徙]] refers in a stylistically unmarked way to removing something permanently to another position. When legalists train their citizens, they ask them to xǐ [[徙]] "remove" an object from one arbitrary place to another.
4. Qiān [[遷]] refers in a stylistically more elevated way to removing something permanently to another position, often as an official or public political measure. The word is also used figuratively for moving someone to a higher position in the hierarchy. See PROMOTE.
