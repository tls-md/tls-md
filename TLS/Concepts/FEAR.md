# Definition
BAD FEELING IN-RELATION-TO what one BELIEVES to be a DANGER which one is TRYING to AVOID.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general word for any kind of passing fear is probably jù [[懼]] and this word naturally links with yōu [[憂]] "worry", and this word refers to a momentary historical moment where that fear manifested itself ( [[文王乃懼]] "then King Wén got scared"). Jù sǐ [[懼死]] is momentary fear for one's life, whereas wèi sǐ [[畏死]] refers to a general state where one is too frightened to sacrifice one's life.
2. Kǒng [[恐]] refers primarily to intense or overwhelming possibly passing state of fear, and the word differs from jù [[懼]] mainly in degree of intensity and in the managability of the danger faced.
3. Wèi [[畏]] is typically a stable state of reasoned fear, typically relating those who are in authority (the etymologically related wēi [[威]] on which relation there is much word-play in texts like ZUO), or ghosts etc, but the word also has extended generalised uses, as in wèi sǐ [[畏死]] "be afraid to die".
4. Jīng [[驚]] refers to the sudden onset of fear when someone is faced with an unexpected danger.
5. Lì [[栗]] / [[慄]] and zhàn [[戰]] is to shiver with intense fear, and the physical expression of fear can be more prominent the inner feeling expressed through shivering.
6. Qiè [[怯]] "chicken-livered and unlikely to undertake risky tasks" and nuò [[懦]] (ant. yǒng [[勇]] "courage, boldness") as well as dàn [[憚]] "unduly prone to feelings of fear" refer to being pusilanimousness or the lack or courage where courage is required.
7. Bù [[怖]] "be in a current acute state of fear" has no weakened generalised uses.
8. Sǒng [[悚]] / [[聳]] "be fretful, given to fear; get slightly frightened" refers to mild forms of (possibly superfluous or reprehensible) fear.
9. Jì [[悸]] refers to symptoms of violent heart-beat caused by intense fear.
NB: Pà [[怕]] is post-Buddhist (TANG).

214. Inter Formidinem, pavorem. et metum, sive [col. 32A] timorem. Formido objicitur, vel oculis, vel animo, sine adhibita ratione, et maxime parvulis, pavor autem cum timiditate animi subita est conturbans occasio, quae tamen solvitur ratione, vel tempore, nec stat, item metus est motus interior animi subitus, sive cordis, factus ex aliqua tristi recordatione. Timor vero est accedens dolor mentis extrinsecus, ex aliqua accidenti occasione. Porro timiditas animi vitium sempiternum est. Nam timor, pro tempore est. Itaque in viro forti est aliquando timor, timiditas nunquam. Est autem et bonus timor et malus. Malus est, cum temporalia bona quisque sibi subtrahi perhorrescit [ Al., abstrahi pertimescit]; bonus, cum quanto quis Deum ardentius diligit, tanto eum diligentius offendere pertimescit. Nam timere interdum [col. 32B] prodest, et decet, pro qualitate temporum atque causarum.

A. CRAINTE, APPREHENSION;   
B. INQUIETUDE, ALARME, PEUR;   
C. EPOUVANTE, EFFROI, FRAYEUR, TERREUR

A. 
Lafaye distinguishes "crainte" of a probable danger and "apprehension" of a possible danger: a brilliant definition.  "Crainte" is a involves an envisioning of what is dangerous, "apprehension" involves a suspicion concerning what may be dangerous.  These two words have the common feature that they focus on the intellectual rather than the emotive part of fear. Malebranche: "La crainte, qui produit la tristesse,, n'est point une emotion de l'ame, mais un simple jugement."  The same may be said about "apprehension".  Both these words are quite different from "inquietude, alarme, peur", even more from "epouvante, effroi, frayeur, terreur".

B. 
"Inquietude, alarme, peur" are weak forms of fear, "inqietude" being the weakest.
"Alarme" is an intense form of "inqietude".
"Peur" is subjective and less based on externals than on inner temperament, and the word is pejorative in the sense that it often denotes a lack of courage.

C. 
"Epouvante" is stronger than "peur", but like "peur" it connotes a tendency to flee from what is dangerous, a lack of proper courage.
"Effroi" connotes horror as well as strong, stifling fear.
"Frayeur" is transitory "effroi".
"Terreur" focusses on the state of the mind as caused by the envisaging of its cause.

畏，恐，懼
1. WL claims that these words are basically synonymous.  In fact, they differ clearly in basic semantic content.  We4i 畏 is basically a state of fear of what inspires awe and respect, perhaps shuddering awe, and indeed there are many cases where the meanings of the words hovers between fear and respect, encompassing elements of both;  ko3ng 恐 is momentary and powerful basically terrified fear of what is simply overpowering, although these words have occasional "blunted" or neutralised usages where they refer to generalised fear; and ju4 懼 is momentary fearful concern about an impending danger, thus a much weaker form of ko3ng 恐.  The cases where these words are interchangeable semantically are few.
2. WL claims that it is characteristic of ko3ng 恐 and ju4 懼 that these have causative uses, but we4i 畏 is also used in such causative senses "inspire fearfuyl awe in people".  Moreover, all these words are current as transitive non-causative words, contrary to what WL suggests.
