# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Qìng 磬 refers to the musical instrument made of stone which was suspended on the wooden construction (usually in a set) and beaten with a wooden stick. This kind of instrument came into use already in the 3rd millenium B.C. Qìng 磬 was together with bells and drums the core instrument of ritual musical assemblages, and it is quite often found in aristocratic tombs dating from the Shang to the Warring States period (most remarkable being an assemblage of 32 pieces from the grave of Marquis Yi of Zeng who died in 433 B.C.). By Han times it was already rare.
2. Qìng 罄 is another way of writing qìng 磬.
