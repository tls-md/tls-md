2. Yǐn [[隱]] (ant. xiǎn [[顯]] "manifestly, demonstratively") refers primarily to hiding something or being hidden from everyone except the person who is hiding it.
3. Yīn [[陰]] (ant. míng [[明]] "openly, for everyone to see") refers to covert actions hidden from a certain person group.
4. Tōu [[偷]] (ant. zhèng [[正]] "regularly and openly") refers to unreglemented inappropriate secrecy.
5. Sī [[私]] (ant. gōng [[公]] "openly") focusses on the aspect of discreetness in secrecy.
6. Jiàn [[間]] (ant. zhèng [[正]] "straightforwardly") refers to the secretiveness of secret agents in espionage and the like.
7. Wēi [[微]] (ant. zhí [[直]] "straightforwardly") typically refers to secrecy achieved through indirectness or subtlety in the form of communication.
