# Definition
SMALL in QUANTITY.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word referring to the relatively small number or the small amount of something is shǎo [[少]] (ant. duō [[多]] "many, much").
2. Guǎ [[寡]] (ant. zhòng [[眾]] "numerous" and occasionally also duō [[多]] "large in quantity") typically refers specifically humans not being numerous as opposed to larger groups of humans, but the word comes to refer also to any quantity being relatively large ( [[五穀多寡]] "the relative abundance of grain") and I have not found a systematic difference in nuance with shǎo [[少]] when the word is so used, except for the generally subjective intuition that guǎ [[寡]] being the dominant word in early times, perhaps retained a somewhat more dignified stylistic value throughout.
3. Fá [[乏]] and kuì [[匱]] (ant. zú [[足]] "enough") refer specifically to the shortage of something one definitely needs more of.
4. Xī [[希]] / [[稀]] and the more archaic xiǎn [[鮮]] refers to sparsity of distribution.
5. Jiǎn [[減]] (ant. zēng [[增]] "increase") refers specifically to the reduction of the amount of the number of something. See also DIMINISH.
