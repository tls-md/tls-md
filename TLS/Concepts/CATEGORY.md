# Definition
ABSTRACT CONCEPT REFERRING TYPICALLY to MANY THINGS with RESEMBLING FEATURES.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general current word for the abstract notion of a category of any kind is lèi [[類]].
2. Shǔ [[屬]] construes a category as something that concrete things belong to or belong under, and the term is not abstract in force.
3. Zhǒng [[種]] "kind" emphasises the common origin and derives from the biological notion of a species, and the term often refers specifically to the kinds of grain.
4. Chóu [[疇]] "natural group a thing belongs to" is not really a logical term of classification but essentially a term belonging to the sociology of animals.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
種類 is the most general current word for a category.
類 is a current slightly more colloquial word for a category.
類別 focusses on the distinguishing function of classification.
品類 refers to a man-made category or class.
類型 prototypically focusses on the shared form of what belongs to one category.
門類 emphasises the man-made nature of the category.
部類 is a literary technical term for a category of things in a major scheme of classification.
項目 refers to categories of activities within a project.
品種 refers technically to a variety of goods for sale.
花色 refers idiomatically to a variety of goods for sale.
