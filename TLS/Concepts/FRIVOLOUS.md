# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general and neutral word for lack of seriousness is qīng [[輕]] (ant. zhuāng [[莊]] "serious").
2. Fú [[浮]] sometimes refers to the kind of flippancy or frivolousness that might call for criticism but is not viewed as entirely serious.
3. Fān fān [[幡幡]] is a poetic word referring to someone who has lost the dignified stance that would give him authority.
