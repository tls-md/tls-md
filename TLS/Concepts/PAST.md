# Definition
PERIOD BEFORE NOW.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general current word for "formerly" referring to any time in the distant or recent past is probably xī [[昔]] (ant. jīn [[今]] "present").
2. Wǎng [[往]] (ant. lái [[來]] "future") is a general technical term for the past.
3. Céng [[曾]] marks an event as belonging to the past, and the word is highly grammaticalised. [[待考]]
4. Cháng [[嘗]] places an action or experience in the past, typically in so far as this past is experienced or witnessed by someone, remarkably often by the speaker himself.
5. Gǔ [[古]] and gǔ zhě [[古者]] refer specifically to ancient times and not just generally to the past.
6. Xiàng [[鄉]] / [[曏]] / [[嚮]] refers to the relatively recent past.
7. Nǎng [[曩]] refers to the somewhat more distant past.
8. Qǐng [[頃]] refer to the period a short time ago.
9. Gù [[故]] tends to be used adjectivally to characterise something as being former rather than present, and the meaning is very neatly distinct from gǔ [[古]] which would characterise something as being old.\
NB: Zuó [[昨]] refers specifically to something happening a day ago. See YESTERDAY.
