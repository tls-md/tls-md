# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current word referring to private feelings of shame is xiū [[羞]] "feel intensely morally ashamed of oneself",
2. The most current word for public shame or disgrace with regard to an action, the core of which is public opinion, is chǐ [[恥]], proper respect for which is also called chǐ [[恥]] "sense for what is publicly disgraceful".
3. Rǔ [[辱]] refers to public humiliation and public disgrace typically caused by overt actions or reactions of others.
4. Kuì [[愧]] expresses a mixture of shame and embarrassment, and the word is the only shame-word to be used as a reflexive verb meaning "be ashamed of and embarrassed about oneself".
5. Cán [[慚]] "feel embarrassed and ill at ease about something" is often close to a feeling of [[不好意思]], and it may naturally apply to things one has said rather than done. Note the current [[心慚]] "feel inwardly ashamed".
6. Zuò [[怍]] refers to being or becoming (typically, but not always, visibly on one's face) upset, typically by feelings of shame.
[INCHOATIVE]
7. Nǎn [[赧]] refers to the external manifestation of feelings of shame through blushing, but the term is not common in pre-Buddhist literature and is marginal in the group.

SHAME
ignominia is the public shame which deprives one of political honour, and this is independent of the reports circulated concerning a person, but is rather the consequence of an official denunciation presupposed to be justified.
infamia is the public shame which preprives one of moral honour and of one駒 good name, and this is based on public scorn which is construed as a consequence of shameless and dishoourable conduct.
dedecus refers to manifest public deviation from honourable conduct itself.
probrum refers to an isolated shameful act, typically a private act, by a person of whom unreproachable action is expected, and which deserves public reproach.
opprobrium refers to a probrum which has actually come to public attention and is the subject of reproach.
