1. The current general word for the exercise of pressure downwards in any concrete or abstract sense is yā 壓, and the word is not a success verb.
2. Zhèn 鎮 adds to the notion of vigorous pressure from above the notion of successfully preventing things from moving or displacing itself in any way.
3. Yì 抑 refers specifically to a particularly vigourous action of pressing something down in any concrete or abstract way and preventing it from moving upwards while possibly allowing it to move sideways.
