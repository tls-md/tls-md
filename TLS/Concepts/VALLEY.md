## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard word for a valley is gǔ 谷 (ant. shān 山 "mountain"), and the word presupposes a certain size without emphasising large size.
2. Xī 谿 (later also written 溪 ) refers to a deep valley, preferably with a stream in it.
3. Huò 壑 (ant. fēng 峰 "mountain top") refers generally to a deep large and impressive valley with or without running water in it, as the season may determine,, and the word is rarely used to refer specifically to a given valley.
## Modern Chinese Criteria

穀
壑
山溝
幽谷
