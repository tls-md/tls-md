# Definition
MOVE DOWNWARDS as a LIQUID.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The dominant standard word for the natural flow of water or any liquid is líú [[流]] (ant. zhì [[滯]] "be blocked").
2. Pèi [[沛]] is to flow abundantly and rapidly.
3. Màn [[漫]] is to overflow in all directions.
4. Yǎn [[衍]] and yǎn [[演]] are both occasionally (and originally!) used to refer to water flowing over long distances.
NB: There are many poetic words in this group which have rather low frequency. Poetically elaborated groups of this kind need a separate study which takes special note of rules of euphony in poetry in addition to semantic considerations.
## Modern Chinese Criteria

流動
流淌
