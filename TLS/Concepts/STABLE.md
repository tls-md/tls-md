# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Láo 牢 is perhaps the most general term for a stable for any animals, but it appears that the term specifically referred to pens without roofs. [The word occurs already in oracle bone inscriptions where it most probably refers to the oxen or sheep raised in pens and then used for sacrifices. The character shows a cow or a sheep within rectangular pen or stable with narrow exit which is similar in shape to the stable known from Han models. [WANG 1993: 195; SUN 1991: 212; JGJWZD 1993: 60 - 61; ill.: SUN 1991: 53-2]
2. Juàn 圈 is a stable for animals, especially sheep and dogs. [(WANG 1993: 195). Dog and sheep stables known from Han models are usually very small: SUN 1991: 212 - 214; ill.: SUN 1991: 53-3, 53-6; HAYASHI 1976: pp. 63, tab. 4-17]
3. Jiù 廄 is the current term for horse stables. [(WANG 1993: 195). Horses were usually under central control, and from Han times there are official seals with titles such us director of horse stables etc.. [SUN 1991: 212 - 214; ill.: SUN 1991: 53-9]
4. Zào 皂 is occasionally used for horse or cattle stables.
5. Lì 櫪 is a current word for horse stables. The word usually refers to the horse trough, but by extension also to the stable.
6. Hùn 溷／圂 is a pigsty. The pigsty was in Han times at the same time used as a toilet. [WANG 1993: 195; SUN 1991: 212; ill.: SUN 1991: 53-4; HAYASHI 1976: pp. 63, tab. 4-16]
7. Jiàn 檻 is a pen used to keep wild animals in captivity.
8. Shí 塒 refers to a chicken pen, and the word occurs already in SHIJING. This is known from one Han model which shows the wall with four holes, with one chicken or duck whithin each. [SUN 1991: 215; XIANG 1997: 573]
9. Xián 閑 is another word for horse stable. [HANYU DACIDIAN 1992: vol. 12: pp. 69]
Jié 桀 refers to the wooden STAKE for chicken; the word is known already from SHJING: SUN 1991: 215; XIANG 1997: 305; SUN 1991: 53-8; HAYASHI 1976: pp. 63, tab. 4-22]
