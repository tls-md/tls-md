# Definition
APPRECIATED BECAUSE RARE, APPRECIATED AND EXPENSIVE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for objective preciousness and real high value and importance is bǎo 寶 (ant. zhuì 贅 "trifles"), and this word often has abstract figurative meanings "what one treasures as most important in one's life".
2. Guì 貴 (ant. jiàn 賤 "cheap") refers to something precious and expensive, and the idea is always that this things are publicly recognised as precious.
3. Zhēn 珍 (ant. yōng 庸 "perfectly ordinary") is always concrete when nominal and refers to preciousness with strong overtones of exquisite and exlusive distinction of the object concerned, and there often is a touch of the subjective. Hence the common combination zhēn guài 珍怪 "precious and exotic things", and the derived meaning of "culinary delicacies".

寶，珍
1. WL: 二字同義. The deep difference is that ba3o 寶 refers to something publicly recognised and objectively construed as a valuable treasure; zhe1n 珍 refers rather to a subjectively highly appreciated thing.  A precious official gift tends to be ba3o 寶, never zhe1n 珍. A state treasure has to be a guo2 ba3o g國寶, never a guo2 zhe1n 國珍.  What is kept in treasuries of state is standardly ba3o 寶, and if zhe1n 珍 were kept, this would be a display of subjectivism on the part of the ruler.  Valuable possessions of all sorts, or wealth, do not constitute ba3o 寶 because such wealth may be judged unimportant.  A large di3ng 鼎 is definitely a ba3o 寶 because it is impossible to doubt its significance and importanc.  Such a di3ng 鼎would certainly not count as a zhe1n 珍. Zho4ng 重 "heavy, weighty" is a natural epithet for ba3o 寶, not for zhe1n 珍.
