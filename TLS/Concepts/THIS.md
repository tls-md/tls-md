The NEAR OBJECT.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current anaphoric or deictic purely referential demonstrative pronoun "this" is cǐ [[此]].
2. Shì [[是]] has a pregnant use meaning "such a" and characteristically refers to something by virtue of its quality (in which function it is not replaceable with cǐ [[此]] ), but in many contexts the word is used as a more generalised referential pronoun.
3. Sī [[斯]] is currently considered as a dialect variant of cǐ [[此]], but this raises many problems.
4. Zhī [[之]] is a an archaic deictic demonstrative pronoun restricted to adnominal position. It stands to reason that the other meanings of this word may be plausibly derived from this archaic meaning.
5. Zhě [[者]] is a highly specialised pronoun always modified by a preceding phrase.

實，寔
1. Note that the two characters are NOT homophonous in classical Chinese.  The reminder of this in WL 227 is useful.  However, it stands to reason that WHEN 實 is used as a loan character for 寔 it should perhaps all the same be read in the pronounciation of the latter word.  The point needs systematic investigation.
