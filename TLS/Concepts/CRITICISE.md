## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general term for criticism is fēi 非 (ant. shì 是 "approve of").
2. Fěi 誹 (ant. zàn 贊 "commend") is to criticise someone's views in a condescending humiliating way. See also SLANDER.
3. Jī 譏 is part of the historian's standard repertoire and refers typically to historian's censure of the behaviour of historical personalities.
4. Zuì 罪 may sometimes come to refer to strong criticism of a person's views and achievements. See ACCUSE
5. Bàng 謗 refers to slanderous criticism, typically not to the fact but behind one's back. See also SLANDER.
## Modern Chinese Criteria

批判 emphasises the element of repudiation and judgment in criticism.
提意見 "raise objections against" emphasises the "ad rem" and not ad hominem nature of criticism.
開炮 "open fire on" dramatises ad hominem criticism in a hyperbolic and sometimes jocular manner.

## 
1. Some words express criticism that is presupposed to be correct (zé 責 ) or is at least typically supposed to be incorrect (bàng 謗 ), others express criticism that is clearly presupposed to false (zèn 譖, chán 讒, zhuó 諑 ).
2. Some words primarily denote face-to-face criticism (jié 訐 ); others always denote criticism behind one's back (fěi 誹 ).
3. Some words express strong criticism likely to lead to punitive action or open conflict (huǐ 毀 ), others express slight dissatisfaction without any implication of future strong punitive action (zǐ 訾 ).

譖慝之言， Maligning vituperative words
無入之耳； will not enter his ears;
批扦之聲， aggressive sounds
無出之口； will not come out of his mouth
殺傷人之孩，
無存之心，
雖有詆訐之民，
無所依矣。
