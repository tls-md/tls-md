# Definition
At the MOMENT WHEN something OTHER has HAPPENED.
NB: THEN is taken as a logical conditional relation, whereas THEREUPON is temporal. The distinction needs much more attention.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[BRIEF/LONG]
[DRAMATIC/UNDRAMATIC]
[EMPHATIC/UNEMPHATIC]
[NOUN/VERB/PARTICLE/CLAUSE]
1. The current general word for "thereupon" is yú shì 於是 "at that point, then, thereupon" with its expanded variant yú shì hū 於是乎, but these expressions do not allow for any long delay.
2. Yǒu jiān 有間 (ant.* xuǎn 旋／還 "without delay", dùn 頓 "immediately, without hesitation") refers to a brief interval of a certain time which ensues, and after which something new happens in the narrative sequence.
[BRIEF], [UNDRAMATIC], [UNEMPHATIC]; [CLAUSE]
3. Yǒu qǐng 有頃 (ant. è ér 俄而 "without delay", lì 立 "without delay") is "after a while" and the interval is perhaps a little longer than in yǒu jiān 有間, and this expression also refers to a plain narrative sequence.
[BRIEF], [UNDRAMATIC], [UNEMPHATIC]; [CLAUSE]
4. Yǐ ér 已而 (ant. qián cǐ 前此 "before this point in time") refers with emphasis to a longer than expected interval after a certain time.
[LONG], [DRAMATIC], [EMPHATIC]; [PARTICLE]
5. Jū 居 (as in jū sān yuè 居三月 "after three months") and the rarer chǔ 處 serve simply to indicate a specified interval after a certain time after which something else happens.
[VERB], [UNDRAMATIC], [UNEMPHATIC]
6. Jì 既 (ant. wèi jí 未及 "before even...") focusses dramatically on the fact that an action B does not occur before the action A is completed.
[BRIEF], [DRAMATIC], [EMPHATIC]; [PARTICLE]
7. Rán hòu 然後 (ant. yǐ qián 以前 "before") emphasises that an event occurs no sooner than after a certain event or space of time. See ONLY THEN.
[BRIEF], [DRAMATIC], [EMPHATIC]; [PARTICLE]
8. Ér hòu 而後 (ant. yǐ qián 以前 "before") emphasises that an event occurs no sooner than after a certain event or space of time. See ONLY THEN.
[BRIEF], [EMPHATIC]; [PARTICLE]
9. Xū yú 須臾 stresses that an event occurred immediately after another.
[BRIEF+]; [nadS]
10. Hòu 後 (ant. qián 前 "before") is a general word indicating that something happens later than something else.

## 
1. Some words usually cooccur with an explicit terminus post quem (hòu 後, jì 既 ), others take the speaker's present time or the time of the last event reported in the context as the terminus post quem (yǐ ér 已而 ).
2. Some words require the specification of "how long afterwards" (chǔ 處, jū 居 ), others exclude such a specification (yǒu jiān 有間 ).
3. Some words require the period of "how long afterwards" to be relatively short (chǔ 處, jū 居, yǒu jiān 有間 ), others specify the time (sù 宿 ); still others place no restriction on the length of this time (hòu 後 ).
4. Some words express a necessary temporally specified precondition or necessary condition (rán hòu 然後 ), others simply describe sequence (yǐ ér 已而, ér 而 etc).
