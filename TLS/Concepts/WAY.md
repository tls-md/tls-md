# Definition
LONG AND NARROW LEVEL PLACE ON which HUMANS GO TO PLACES OR TRAVEL TO DISTANT PLACES.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word for streets and roads is tú [[塗]]／[[涂]]／[[途]].
2. The general word for an established way along which humans move conveniently in the landscape is lù [[路]], and this term covers all manner of large and wide roads as well as small paths of any kind. (For streets within cities see STREET)
3. Dào [[道]], when used in its concrete meaning referring to a means of communication tends to refer to a larger line of communication, and the traditional claim is that the term refers to a road where two vehicles can pass each other. Thus the First Emperor called his Autobahns chí dào [[馳道]] and not chí lù [[馳路]].
4. Jiē qú [[街衢]] refers to the highways of the land in a general way.

道，路，途
1. WL overlooks the decisive difference that lu4 路 is commonly used for any line of communication by which one reaches from one point to another, whereas da4o  道, even when used as a concrete word, is a always a more dignified term, in clear opposition to a merely convenient ji4ng 徑. LAO plays on this when it says 大道甚夷而民好徑 "the great way (Way) is even, but the people love the small paths".
