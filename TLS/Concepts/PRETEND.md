# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for pretending to be what one is not is yáng 佯 (ant.* zhēn xiàng 真相 "real shape").
2. Wěi 偽 (ant. zhēn 真 "genuine") refers to the deliberate production of something artificial, and by extension the word comes to mean "pretend".
3. Shì 飾 (ant. pǔ 樸 "basic and genuine, unadorned") refers to ostentatious pretence.
4. Wū 誣 (ant. xìn 信 "trusty") emphaises the fraudulent aspect of pretense.
5. Wēi fú 微服 and wēi xíng 微行 refer specifically to a notorious person going out and pretending to be an ordinary citizen of some kind or another.
6. Jiǎ 假 (ant. zhēn 真 "genuine") is rare in pre-Buddhist times and refers to pretending to do something.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
假裝 is the current modern word for pretending.
偽裝 focusses on the artificiality of the pretence.
裝作 focusses on the creativeness of act of pretending.
作偽 focusses on the act of dissimulating pretence itself rather than its result.
裝假 "feign, make pretences" is often intransitive.
假充 "pose as" is always transitive.
佯裝 (lit) focusses on the dissimulation involved in pretending.
弄虛作假 (prov) refers generally to acts of pretense.
