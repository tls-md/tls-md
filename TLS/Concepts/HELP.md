3. Zuǒ 佐, yòu 佑 (deriving their meaning from the position of aides near the ruler), and also fǔ 輔 refer to official assistance in a formal context.
4. Fú 扶 is specifially help to those much in need of support.

6. Jiǎ 假 refers to - not necessarily overt - discreet support.
7. Zī 資 refers primarily to providing material support, but the word came to have common wider, generalised applications.
8. Jì 濟 refers to acute help for a current difficult task.
