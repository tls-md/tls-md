# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard dominant word is rù [[入]] (ant. chū [[出]] "go out") which refers to any kind of concrete or abstract entering of a thing into another.
2. Nà [[納]] / [[內]] is causative and refers to letting enter or causing to enter.
3. Zhù [[注]] refers to causing liquids to enter a a container. [See also POUR]
4. Guàn [[灌]] refers to causing water to enter a location (prototypically for irrigation). [See POUR.]
NB: Jìn [[進]] "to enter" occurs only from JIN DYNASTY times onwards, as far as I have been able to see.

ENTER
intrare refers to concrete entering into a marked physical space, and it tends to function as a transitive verb.
introire "step into a marked space" is intansitive, but takes preposition-phrase objects.
ingredi refers to any entering into a marked or unmarked space.
inire refers almost invariably to a rigurative entering into an activity.

1. The point about ji4n 進 never meaning "to enter into" in any pre-Buddhist source is certainly right, but of course this point does not establish any synonymy relation for classical Chinese in pre-Buddhist times. The words have nothing to do with each other in our period.
