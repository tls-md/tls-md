# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general words for investigating something are chá 察 "sort out clearly" and shen 審 "investigate carefully".
2. Kǎo 考 and jī 稽 refer to an objective investigation into something on the basis of the best available evidence.
3. Xǐng 省 typically refers to investigation by introspection.
4. Jiū 究 and qióng 窮 emphasise the thoroughness and exhaustiveness of an investigation.
5. Xiáng 詳, xī 悉, and dì 諦 focus on the detailed nature of an investigation without insisting on its exhaustiveness.
6. Yuán 原 refers to a principled investigation into all aspects of a topic, getting to the bottom of a matter.

NB: pàn 判涄 ome to a result in an investigation � does not refer to the investigation itself but only the final act of judgment on the result; dng 定洖 etermine (the truth of a matter) is a resultative verb. Duàn 斷烒 each a conclusion on an investigation � is close to pàn 判.
