# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[BASIC/DERIVED]
[CURRENT/RARE]
[DEROGATORY/COMMENDATORY]
[DRAMATIC/UNDRAMATIC]
[+FIG/LITERAL]
[FORMAL/INFORMAL]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[TRANSITORY/LASTING]
1. Jiān 兼 "annex" (ant. gē 割 (incidentally, anciently homophone of modern English "cut"!!!) "to cut off") is the neutral word used by the historian to record the facts without bias.
[FORMAL], [GENERAL]
2. Tūn 吞 "gulp up and annex" is metaphorical in nature, and pejorative as well as dramatic in force.
[DERIVED], [DEROGATORY], [DRAMATIC], [INFORMAL]; [[RARE]]
3. Bìng 并 "annex" (ant. fēn 分 "separate into two") is less formal, and is the commonest of the three.
[GENERAL], [INFORMAL]
4. Bìng 並 "annex" (ant. fēn 分 "separate into two") is sometimes used synonymously with bìng 并 but is not anciently homophonous with it, and the word is particularly current in the meaning of "together". See TOGETHER [NB: what confuses the situation is a great deal of printer's confusion in entering these different words, greatly exacerbatged by the problem of computerisation.]
[GENERAL], [INFORMAL]
5. Yǒu 有 can come to refer to the more or less lasting result of the process of annexation. See GOVERN(INCHOATIVE)
[COMMENDATORY], [FORMAL], [INCHOATIVE], [LASTING], [STATE]
6. Jù 據 can refer to the more or less lasting the result of the process of annexation.
[LASTING], [RESULT], [STATE]; [[RARE]]
