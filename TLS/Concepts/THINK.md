4. Tú [[圖]] refer to deliberative strategic thinking about the future by a person in authority to decide on a future course of action.
5. Xiǎng [[想]] is occasionally used to refer to fond thinking about absent persons, and in later times the word comes to refer to unrealistic imaginings in thought, and wàng xiǎng [[妄想]] "wild imaginings" is a symptomatic current phrase..
6. Niàn [[念]] refers to intense intellectual effort and strenuous attention, and zhèng niàn [[正念]] refers to correct intellectual efforts in Buddhist Chinese.
7. Zhēn zhuó [[斟酌]] refers to careful deliberation on the truth of a proposition or the moral quality of something.
