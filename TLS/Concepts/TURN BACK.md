# Definition
WALK IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION one was WALKING, TYPICALLY INTENDing to RETURN. 
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
The standard word for changing direction and turning to one side is huán [[還]]. [[馬還]] "the horses turn round" contrasts with tuì [[退]] "withdraw" in that there is no focus on the turning round in tui [[退]], and no ultimate aim of the withdrawal is envisaged.
[THIS NEEDS CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND REVISION]
## Modern Chinese Criteria
退還
回還
THIS NEEDS CAREFUL ATTENTION: THERE MUST BE BETTER WORDS.
