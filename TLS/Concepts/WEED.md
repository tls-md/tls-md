# Definition
AGRICULTURAL WORK INTENDING to REMOVE WEEDS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general ancient word for removing weeds is nòu [[耨]]／[[鎒]], and the word refers specifically to a short-handled iron tool as illustrated, and this tool became common in Warring States times. The handle, like all ancient handles, was short. Probably, it is a further development of the ancient bó [[鎛]]
2. Chú [[鋤]]／[[鉏]]／[[耡]] is to remove weeds by hacking the earth with a tool of the illustrated kind with a long handle.
3. Bó [[鎛]] was an ancient short-handled hoe with a bronze head.
