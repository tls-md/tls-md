# Criteria and general notes
## Modern Chinese Criteria
We need to investigate exactly when concepts of this order arose in China.
In Modern Chinese, comparison between 修訂現代漢語詞典 and DeFrancis, ABC Dictionary. The picture here is the same as in a large number of other such sensitive cases:
善感 refers both to sensitivity and sentimentality. 容易引起感觸
傷感 refers to sadness, distress as well as sentimentality. 因感觸而悲傷
溫情 refers to warm-heartedness as well as sentimentality. 溫柔的感情
Lin Yutang defines
兒女態 as "childishness; sentimentality; lack of manliness"
多情 as "affectionate; also sentimental" 重感情（多指愛情）
