# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for uncleanness and dirt, both concrete and abstract, is wū [[污]] / [[汙]] (ant. jié [[潔]] "clean").
2. Zhuó [[濁]] (ant qīng [[清]] "clear and pure") typically refers to physical states of dirtiness, but there are occasional usages like zhuó lì [[濁吏]] "morally impure official".
3. Huì [[穢]] can refer to physical dirt, but the word is also used abstractly to refer to what is vulgar and morally distasteful.
4. Hún [[混]] refers to an admixture of dirt rather than to the presence of dirt on some surface.
5. Gòu [[垢]] refers to the presence of physical dirt on some surface.
