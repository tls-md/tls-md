eirênê, f., (from eirô, "to tie") is the current word for peace with connotations of duration. The word not only denotes absence of warfare, but absence of conflict in general. It is found personified as the name of a goddess.
anokhê, f., (from anekhô, "to hold up", hence: "cease") refers specifically to peace following warfare, i. e. a truce or armistice.  
anakôkhê, f., (variant form: anokôkhê) is found only in Thucydides where Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Ad Amm. de Thuc.) criticizes the word as being obsolete and unintelligible. The word shares the etymology of anokhê and is used in a similar sense.
ekekheiria, f., (from ekhô, "to hold (sc. back)" and kheir, 1f, "hand") appears to be used in a similar sense as anokhê.
diokôkê, f.,  (from diekhô, "to hold apart") is a rare word used in Dio Cassius to refer to a pause in warfare, i. e. a temporary peace/ armistice (in Thucidides it refers to a pause in an epidemic).
