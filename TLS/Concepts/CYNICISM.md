DOCTRINE that one SHOULD DESPISE ALL THINGS AND PERSONS BECAUSE THEY LACK REAL VALUE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
To the student of ancient philosophy there is in Cynicism scarcely
more than a rudimentary and debased version of the ethics of
Socrates, which exaggerates his austerity to a fanatic asceticism,
hardens his irony to sardonic laughter at the follies of mankind,
and affords no parallel to his genuine love of knowledge.
Well might Plato have said of the first and greatest Cynic,
'That man is Socrates gone mad.' Dudley p. ix
Cynicism is
usually presented to us in histories of Greek philosophy, where
it forms an interlude of semi-comic relief between Socrates and
Plato, or between Plato and the Stoics.
