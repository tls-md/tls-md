# Definition
RELATION between two SENCENCES S1 AND S2 such that IF NOT S1 THEN S2.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. There is no word for "or" linking declarative sentences. The current paraphrase is fēi [[非]]...zé [[則]] "if not..., then".
2. The current general word between alternative questions is yì [[抑]].
3. Qí [[其]] "or should one" is idiomatic in deliberating questions.
4. Between NPs ruò [[若]] and yǔ [[與]] are very occasionally used to mean "or".
NB: Jiāng [[將]] "or else, otherwise" is marginal in this group because it does not involve the logical connective "or".
