沽，酤，賈
1. WL claims these three "characters" are homophonous, but since 沽 anciently had three, and in modern times still has two readings, this statement makes no sense.  
2. WL claims that gu3 酤 is not used to refer to a merchant.  This is not so.  SHANGJUNSHU 2 has sha1ng gu1 商酤 "traders and wine-merchants", and along similar lines we have the current tu2 gu1 屠酤 "butchers and wine merchants".
