# Definition
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE'S AVOIDABLE PAST BAD ACT. 
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The dominant standard general word for any kind of guilt, large or small, is zuì [[罪]] (ant. gōng [[功]] "merit"), but this does not refer to any feelings of guilt; the general term for feelings of guilt is jiù [[疚]] REGRET.
2. Qiān [[愆]], (sometimes written qiān [[騫]] ) refers to slight guilt or responsibility for a mistake.
3. Yóu [[尤]] refers to the blame one suffers for a misdeed.
For zéi [[賊]], a dramatic derogatory term referring to abject villainy, see VILLAIN.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
罪感 translates the Western notion of guilt.
犯罪感 is an expanded and perhaps slightly more common translation.
