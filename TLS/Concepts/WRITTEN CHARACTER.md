# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current standard word for a Chinese character is wén 文, and in certain late contexts only the word refers to non-compound characters.
2. Another word for a character, particularly a compound character, is zì 字.
3. A generic term for characters emphasising the orthographic style to which they belong is shū 書.
4. Míng 名 refers to characters (character types, not tokens) insofar as they are construed as designating something.
5. Mìng 命 is a term that refers to the act of assigning a character to a certain meaning. See NAME.
