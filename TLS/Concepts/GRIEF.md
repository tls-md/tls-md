# Definition
INTENSELY SAD IN-RELATION-TO a DEATH OR a BIG DISASTER.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for deep sorrow is āi [[哀]] (ant. lè [[樂]] "profound joy"), and this word refers to an inner state of mind that typically finds expression in ritualised action, and the feeling is prototypically directed not at bereavement as such but at a deceaed person.
2. Tòng [[慟]] refers to an excessive display of grief.
3. Yōu [[憂]] "worry" (ant. xǐ [[喜]] "joy") can occasionally come to refer to intense worry with a strong admixture of grief, and this usage must be regarded as a polite periphrasis. (For the main meaning of this word see WORRY.)
4. Bēi āi [[悲哀]] is a common abstract and dignified way of referring to grief.
5. A4o nǎo [[懊惱]] is a common vernacular way of referring to grief, which became especially common in Buddhist literature.

GRIEF/MOURNING
dolor is a psychological concept referring to the sentiments of grief as deeply felt.
tristitia refers to the natural and often involuntary manifestation of grief in one's daily behaviour or comportment, including typically one's facial expression and bodily comportment, a morose - sometimes purly intellectual - gloominess of temporary disposition that does not necessarily invite sympathy.
moestitia refers to the natural and often involuntary manifestation of lasting an highly emotional grief. The word is close in meaning to tristitia, but possibly stonger, and the word describes a state which clearly invites sympathy in those who witness it.
moeror refers to the lively expression of dolor.
luctus is the conventional and typically ritualised public expression of grief.
