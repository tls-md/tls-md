## 
MORALITY is universal, ETHICS is local, and DEONTOLOGY is theoretical. The KEY IDEA of ethics is that not only actions are to be preferred because they are prescribed as good or bad, but that also competing systems of preference or prescription regarding what is good or bad must themselves be preferred to each other on a principled and reasoned basis.
