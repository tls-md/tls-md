1. WL claims that go4ng 貢 is generally to the emperor whereas xia4n 獻 refers to giving a respectful gift to anyone.  In fact, all courts had the go4ng 貢 system, and the crucial point is that go4ng 貢 refers to the formal and ritual presentation of what is owed as tribute, whereas xia4n 獻 can refer to anything one wishes to respectfully give to superiors.
