# Definition
METHOD USING SOUND USING which HUMANS MUTUALLY COMMUNICATE AND EXPRESS MEANING.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most abstract philosophical and general term for language is yán 言.
2. Yǔ 語 refers to speech as part of a dialogue, but very often also generally to a language of one kind or another.
3. Yīn 音 refers to language as primarily manifested in special forms of oral articulation, but the word also often refers to a specific language in general.
4. Wén 文 refers to language as primarily manifested in specific ways of writing it down, but the word also often refers to a specific language in general. Gāosēngzhuàn p. 329 that someone 手執梵文口宣晉語。 "In his hand he held the Sanskrit text and with his mouth pronounced Jìn language."
5. Huà 話 refers to language as concrete utterance, typically as part of dialogue, and the word which is so common in modern Chinese is quite rare in classical Chinese.
6. Fāng yán 方言 (Míng dynasty occasional variant: 方語 ) refers to a local language or dialect, as spoken in a given place.
7. Yányǔ 言語 and the somewhat rarer yǔyán 語言 refer to language and linguistic articulatory activity in a general abstract way.
8. Yǔyīn 語音 and yányīn 言音 refer to oral articulatory aspects of language in a general and abstract way.
9. Yīn yì 音義 is a rare expression referring abstractly to a local variety of linguistic conventions linking sound and meaning.
10. Wén zì 文字 refers to the written language.

## Modern Chinese Criteria
語言 is the general word for language.
言語 is a more literary way of referring to what in French is parole "language use, speech".

## 
The abstract notion of "language" versus "speech" is often unclear. The standard way of saying Dialect X has the word N is to say "in X they say/it is called N".
Thus the notion of a language/dialect does not enter the formulation.
Dictionaries of the Chinese language, even dialect dictionaries, do not identify the Chinese language. Thus we have the Dictionary Fāngyán 方言 "Local words/speech" which is a dicitionary of the languages/dialects in China, and we do not have anything like a Zhōngguó Fāngyán 中國方言 "Chinese Dialects" from ancient China.
The syononym dictionary Ěryǎ 爾雅 as well as the Shuōwén Jiězì 說文解字 (henceforth SW) are concerned with language or vocabulary as such rather than the mere explanation of texts. The intellectual consequences of this need to be explored.
In pre-Buddhist texts like the Shuōwén we have 魯語，宋魯語，齊語，秦語, and in cases like these it is plausible to take 語 to mean "way of speaking>language, linguistic practice" of the area concerned.
The expression Fāngyǔ 方語 in SW refers to local speech or dialect in general.
In XIANYUJING we regularly have Jìnyǔ 晉語 "Jìn language", and in Tang texts we have Tángyǔ 唐語 as well as Tángyán 唐言. All these appear to be ways of referring to some kind of standard Chinese. Thus in these connections 語 would seem to have the meaning "way of speaking> language".
Note qīnyán 禽言 "language of the beasts" and 鳥語 "language of the birds" in which it would seem that an abstract notion like that of language, even more abstract than that of human language in general, is operative.
When we read in bears witness to the existence of bilingualism.

LANGUAGE
lingua refers to speech of any, even the most uncultivated barbarian people, in as far as they pssess proper words to express their notions. Like the tongue, lingua is something one is taken to have, naturally, and the owrd refers to t mere gift of speech.
sermo refers to the speech of a cultivated people, insofar as it is adapted for the expression of complex civilised thought. Sermo is more elaorate and refers to a voluntary activity involving rules of grammar as well as of style.
