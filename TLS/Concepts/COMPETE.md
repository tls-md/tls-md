# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The clearly dominant general word for competition or struggle, both hostile and friendly, is zhēng [[爭]] and the focus is on the conflict rather on what is being fought for. See STRUGGLE
2. Jìng [[競]] is to compete strenuously, and to vie for something viewed as desirable, and the focus is not so much on the conflict involved as on the aim pursued.
3. Jiǎo [[角]] is a rare elevated word for competition.
