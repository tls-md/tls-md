# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Lì [[礪]] refers to the whetstone which is - according to the SHUOWEN - rather crude. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1116; WANG 1993; 228]
2. Lì [[厲]] is another (perhaps more archaic) term for the lì [[礪]]; it is known already from SHIJING: HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 1, pp. 936; YANG 2000: 57 - 58; WANG 1993; 228]
3. Dǐ [[砥]] refers to the finer whetstone than lì [[礪]]. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1020; WANG 1993; 228]
4. Zhi [[底]] 3 is another term for dǐ [[砥]] [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 3, pp. 1219; WANG 1993; 228]
5. Cuò [[錯]] refers to a whetstone, and the word occurs already in SHIJING; according to commentaries it was used in processing jades. [XIANG 1997: 93]
6. Cuò [[厝]] is a different term for cuò [[錯]]. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 1, pp. 926]
7. Lián (I have not found the character in a list): according to SHUOWEN red whetstone: HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1093]
8. Jiān [[礛]] was used in processing of jades. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1116]
9. Xíng [[硎]] refers to some kind of whetstone which was used to sharpen implements or to brush up jades. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1042]
NB: It is difficult to distinguish these terms which and attribute them to concrete archaeological finds; but it is quite probable that part of them, particularly lì [[礪]] and lì [[厲]] were quite simple implements like these illustrated in XIANG 1997: pp. 58, fig. 1, 2. Round grindstones or whetstones seems to be no older than the Warring States period (CHEN 1991: 199).
