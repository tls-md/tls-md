# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[[CURRENT/RARE]]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[LARGE-SCALE/SMALL-SCALE]
1. The current ancient general word for any kind of arrow is shǐ [[矢]], and specifically the word refers in from Han times onwards to wooden-shaft rather than bamboo shaft arrows.
[GENERAL]; [[CURRENT]]
2. Jiàn [[箭]] came to mean bamboo shaft arrow from Qin times onwards, and the word originally refers specifically to the bamboo shaft of an arrow, from Warring States onwards. Even in Tang times, the word often retains its primary reference to the shaft rather than the arrow as a whole. From Eastern Han and especially Three Kingdom times onwards, the word comes to be used as a colloquial equivalent of shǐ [[矢]]. Note that since all arrows appear to have been made of bamboo, the word jiàn [[箭]] does not mark out bamboo arrows from others. [Warring States and Han arrows ill.: LIU 1999: 72]
[SPECIALISED]
3. Yì [[弋]] refers to an arrow with string attached.

4. Zhuó [[繳]] refers primarily to the strings attached to yì [[弋]] "stringed arrows", but can occasionally refer to the arrow with the string.

5. Zēng [[矰]] refers to a particularly short stringed arrow.
