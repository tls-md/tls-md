# Definition
THING which HAS the COMMON FEATURES of a certain CATEGORY.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
The abstract notion of a generalisation being absent in Chinese, it is not surprising that the abstract notion of a "concrete example" is also not well represented in the vocabulary. I found only an isolated usage of the word tǐ 體 that seemed relevant, AND UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE LOST IT.
1. The highly current verbal phrase to say that something is a relevant example is to say 是之謂也 "this is a case in point/an example". But the nominal use seems absent.
