# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The standard current word for a command is lìng 令, and the content (not the words) of the command is typically in the sentence that follows. We do not find: 令曰, and it is significant that lìng 令 also regularly means "to cause to".
2. Mìng 命 is typically an order from a person of high, perhaps even supernatural, authority, and what follows are often the words used to express the order. 命曰. Mìng 命 is an order on a higher level than lìng 令.
3. Shǐ 使 often refers to a superior getting or sending subordinates to do something by an order, but this word never focusses on the form of words used. See SEND, CAUSE TO
4. Zhì 制 is a formalised administrative instruction on procedure.
5. Huī 麾 is an order given prototypically by signal of the hand, and in the process of a battle.
6. Hào 號 is a publicly proclaimed political command or instruction.
7. Wèi 謂 is simply a way of telling someone to do something, informally or formally, but without the formal force of a rigid order.
8. Chì 敕 / 飭 is an order from a person in an elevated position, and in post-Buddhist times chì 敕 came to refer standardly to imperial orders.

1. Zhu1 Ju4nshe1ng already noticed the non-logocentric nature of the order called li4ng 令, as WL points out, but the crucial point that even in the case of a verbal command, li4ng 令 still does not focus on that verbal element and cannot be followed by a verb of saying.
