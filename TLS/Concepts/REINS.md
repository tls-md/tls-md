# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The very current general word for reins is pèi 轡, and these are usually made of silk. [The word occurs often in SHIJING and in ZUOZHUAN. The term refers to the reins used to drive a chariot. In Chunqiu times chariot was usually pulled by four horses, so when one excludes two nà 軜 which were not held in the hands (see below), the driver held six reins in the hands. Reins were usually held by both hands, three in each.
2. Jiāng 韁 is colloquial and refers to the reins used for one single horse only.
3. Bà 靶 refers to the reins. The oldest evidence I have found dates from the Han.
4. Nà 軜 refers to the inner reins of the outside horses in a horse team. These were not held in the hands, but instead this they were fixed to the frontal part of a chariot box. The word occurs already in SHIJING.
5. Dí ｄｉ refers in LIJI to the horse reins.
6. Mí (I have not found the character in a list) refers to the rope for leading cattle.
7. Zhèn 紖 is another term for the rope used to lead cattle.
8. Xiè 紲 refers to the rope used to hold a dog.
