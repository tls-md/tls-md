誰，孰:  
1. When referring to humans, WL claims these are synonymous.  This is not so for many interesting reasons.  In 追我者誰也？they are certainly not interchangeable, shu2 孰 not being able to function predicatively.
2. Much more importantly, the two are not interchangeable in the following, where the pronoun shu2 孰 creates a comparative context in a way that she2i 誰 does not.  Indeed, this is the basis semantic difference between the words:
HF 08.07:02; jiaoshi  707; jishi 123; jiaozhu 67; shiping 339
孰疏孰親？ who then is distant, who close?
3. Only she2i 誰 can be followed by zhi1 之, where it is by no means always clear how "personal" or "personified" the subject is, although WL are right, of course, that in general the reference is human or personified:
LAO 4
吾不知誰之子， One does not know not whose son it is.
4. Note that in the following the two question particles are not at all interchangeable.  誰好學 "who likes study" is not the same as 孰好學 "who is most fond of study":
LY 06.03; tr. CH
「弟子孰為好學？」 "Of the disciples, which one is most eager to study?"
