## Old Chinese Criteria

2. Píng [[平]] (ant. luàn [[亂]] "chaos") is prototypically an unruffled smooth surface, and the word refers to a state of harmonious tranquility, particularly in a community of people.
3. Níng [[寧]] (ant. yáng [[殃]] "a totally disastrous state") refers to a state of affairs, primarily in a community of people, where disturbances have ceased.
4. Yì [[佚]] / [[逸]] (ant. láo [[勞]] "engaged in exhausting effort") refers to restful peace of mind, typically after effort.
5. Tián [[恬]] and dàn [[淡]] (all ant. dòng dàng [[動蕩]] "be all over the place) refer to serenity in an individual as cultivated, notoriously, by the Taoists.
6. Jìng [[靜]] (ant. zào [[躁]] "flurried), is a state of mind in which one refuses to be rushed into any action and is fully at ease.
7. Tài [[泰]] (all ant. jí [[急]] "be off balance or in urgent need of something, be in a critical state") and yí [[夷]] (ant. jīng [[驚]] "be upset") refers to relaxation, the state of being détendu.
