# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. General word for the seal was originally xǐ [[璽]], and this could refer to the seals used both by officials and commoners, particularly traders. Originally, seals perhaps served mainly to the exchange of goods in Warring States times, but in the same period they came to be used by officials as a symbol of administrative authority. Official documents had to be all sealed with a piece of mud adhered on the cord tying up the document and impressed with an official seal. In the Han period, the word xǐ [[璽]] came to refer to the seals used by an Emperor and members of his family; these were usually made of jade.
2. Yìn [[印]] refers to the seals used by officials as a symbol of authority and also status in the bureaucratic hierarchy. The word began to be used in the Warring States period. Seals were worn tied to the waist (perhaps in a small sack; but there are also sealing fingerrings known from the Han period), were mostly of square shape, and material of which they were made expressed status of their holders. According to Han texts, the highest officials and aristocracy had golden seals, the lower silver, and minor officials had seals made of bronze.
3. Zhāng [[章]] is the word for the official seal which was used since Han times onwards.
4. Fēng ní [[封泥]] refers to the the piece of mud adhered on a document and impressed with a seal. The mud used for this purpose was worn in special tubes.
