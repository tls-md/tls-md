# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for approximation to completeness of action is jī [[幾]].
2. Dài [[殆]] (ant. bì [[必]] "certainly and completely") is very occasionally used to refer to the only approximate completion of an action.
3. Shù jī [[庶幾]] refers to the approximation to a desirable completing of an action and is always abstract.
