# Definition
POLITE GENEROSITY FOR FOREIGNERS, STRANGERS OR GUESTS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The notion of hospitality towards strangers in need and to travellers passing through which is so important in ancient Greece is not as prominent in China as it was in Greece. The closest one can come is hòu 厚 "meet with polite respect and generous hospitality" (ant. báo 薄 "fail to treat with generous hospitality and proper respect").
2. Lǐ 禮 "show polite respect to" (ant. màn 慢 "treat without proper respect") refers to ritualised respect which is the Chinese Way of hospitality and does connote conviviality. See also RESPECT.
