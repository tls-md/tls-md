# Definition
CONTROL by KEEPING IN one's HANDS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general and neutral word for holding something in any way concrete or abstract is chí 持 (ant. shī 失 "lose hold of").
2. Zhí 執 is often inchoative "take hold of", and then comes to mean "hold on to, keep holding" as one goes along.
3. Cāo 操 refers to holding and holding onto something, often taking it along as one goes along, sometimes wielding it as a weapon.
4. Bǐng 秉 refers to clasping something firmly, often solemnly with both hands, and sometimes several things so as to hold and keep them together and not to let go.
5. Jiá 挾 refers specifically to holding something under one's armpit, but the word also has some more generalised uses.
6. Wò 握 and bǎ 把 are rather dramatic words referring to gripping something and not letting go of it.
7. Gǒng 拱 refers to holding something politely in both hands.
