# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for "when" is the pre-sentential bì 比.
2. Jí 及 and zhì 至 is somewhat less grammaticalised and works like "when things got to the point when".
3. Dāng 當 "during the period when" refers both to very short and quite periods of time.
4. Qí 其 "when" really only serves to mark a general subordinating particle which occasionally comes to be translatable by "when".
5. Yě 也 is frequently used at the end of sentences to form temporal subordinate clauses which provide background, often in conjunction with qí 其.
NB: Sentence-final shí 時 "at the time when" is very rare in pre-Buddhist texts but becomes ubiquitous in Buddhist literature. The predecessor of this construction "S 之時 " "when S happened" is current in pre-Buddhist texts.
