## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for something being bent is qū [[曲]] (ant. zhí [[直]] "make straight").
2. Qū [[屈]] / [[詘]] (all ant. shēn [[伸]] "stretch out") refers specifically to the bending of the body, mostly when bowing politely.
3. Náo [[撓]] (ant. zhèng [[正]] "straighten out")typically focusses on the act and impact of bending.
4. Wǎng [[枉]] (ant. zhèng [[正]] "straight and unwarped") refers to bending as distortion. The word is predominantly transferred in meaning and prototypically refers to the bending of the law.
5. Wān [[彎]] (ant.zhí [[直]] "keep straight") has rather limited uses in pre-Buddhist Chinese, referring to the bending of a bow.
