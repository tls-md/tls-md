# Definition
FOLLOW so as to TRY to REACH OR CATCH.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for pursuing something or going after something in a hostile way, driving what is pursued before one, competing with it for speed, is zhú [[逐]] and the word can only very occasionally refer to abstract pursuits like that of wisdom, as in the venatio sapientiae of Nicolas Cusanus. It is significant that the word currently means "to expel", where expelling and chasing are not always easy to distinguish.
2. Zhuī [[追]] refers to the attempt of catching up with anything, characteristically a kòu [[寇]] "enemy" or thief (who may not know he is being pursued) but without any attending notion that what is being caught up with is NECESSARILY trying to escape or to make great speed, and the word is regularly used in figurative derived meanings "to seek", as in zhuī lì [[追利]] "chasing after profit".
3. Suǒ [[索]] emphasises the seeking aspect in the pursuit of something or someone.
4. Jí [[及]] and the rarer dài [[逮]] refer to a successful pursuit. See CATCH UP
5. Qū [[驅]] suggests a hot and fast pursuit typically uncrowned by success.

追，逐
1. WL claims that at the earliest stage zhu2 逐 refers to the pursuit of wild beasts.  The reference, here, should be specifically to Jiaguwen, becasuse the one occurrence in the old part of SHU refers to human objects, and the word does not come in SHI.  Moreover, in ZUO, what is pursued by way of animals is very little indeed: fish, dogs and the like, and very little of the bovines, boar, tigers and the like the prevail throughout Jiaguwen.  This kind of discontinuity of usage is quite interesting.
