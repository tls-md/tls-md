1. WL 240 quotes with approval DUAN YUCAI on the terminological changes within the field of the vocabulary of footwear. However, it does appear that the late xie2 鞋 differs from the other words not only in its late currency but also in the fact that the shoes involved always have shoelaces.  However, this is a fine point that needs further research.
