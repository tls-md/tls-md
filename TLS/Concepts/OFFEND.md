# Definition
REFUSE TO OBEY OR CONFORM.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current most general word for offending against what one is obliged to act in accordance with or going against a current is probably nì 逆 (ant. shùn 順 "follow and obey"), which refers to any action which goes against something.
2. Fàn 犯 (ant. cǒng 從 "follow obediently") refers as a derogatory term to a deliberate and active breaking of a rule.
3. Gān 干 and gān 奸 are rare words referring specifically to culpable breach of the law.
4. Wéi 違 (ant. xún 循 "follow") and the rarer lí 離 as well as fēi 非 are neutral terms referring to a failure to comply with something.
5. Fú 拂 refers to something grating against sensibilities or creating a conflict.
6. Fáng 妨 adds to the failure of compliance the nuance of interference with what one fails to comply with.
7. Kuī 虧 adds to the failure of compliance the nuance of inflicting harm or damage on what one fails to comply with.
8. Shāng 傷, hài 害, and bài 敗 add to the failure of compliance the element of ruining what one has failed to comply with exactly by this failure of compliance; but hài 害 has developed a special related meaning of offending logically against something, i.e. being incompatible with it.
