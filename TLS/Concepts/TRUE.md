# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current word is rán 然 "it is so" (ant. fǒu 否 "be untrue"), and what is said to be so is a yán 言 "statement', and things are claimed to be as stated in that statement.
2. Kě 可 refers to logical or ethical acceptability.
3. Xìn 信 (ant. zhà 詐 "fraudulent and not reliable") refers prototypically to reliablity as information.
4. Shì 是 (ant. fēi 非 "wrong") refers prototypically to what invites assent or approval.
5. Zhēn 真 (ant. jiǎ 假 "fake") typically refers to what contains nothing faked or unreal and is genuinely true.
6. Dāng 當 (ant. guò 過 "wrong") refers prototypically to what fits the facts and does not deviate.
7. Yǒu 有 (ant. wú 無 "there is no such fact")refers abstractly to the occurrence of an event or the truth of an abstract proposition.
8. Chéng 誠 (ant. wěi 偽 "faked") refers to honest truth. (Note that chéng 誠 normally means "earnest" in early texts and has nothing to do with this meaning.)
9. Shí 實 "real and true" (ant. xū 虛 "only apparently") refers to something not being a figment of the imagination. See REAL.

真，誠
1. WL considers that in the meaning zhe1nche2ng 真誠 these two words are synonymous, and it quotes SHUOWEN on zhe1n 真: 僊人變形而登天也 as evidence of what the primary meaning of zhe1n 真 is.  This definition is highly interesting, of course, but not because it describes the basic meaning of the word.  Change of form has nothing to do with that basic meaning, and rising to heaven has precious little to do with it either.  The time has come to discontinue this practice of mechanical quotation of SHUOWEN for pretended primary meanings of words.
2. The special feature of zhe1n 真 comes out when you consider its antonym jia3 假 "fake".
