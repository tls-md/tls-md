BECAUSE of WHAT? [GRAMMAR]
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general word for "why" is probably xī 奚.
2. Hé yǐ 何以 typically asks for a reason in the form of a purpose, but the word can also ask for a good intellectual reason, as in hé yǐ zhī zhī 何以知之 "how do you know".
3. Hú 胡 is a dialect word which often asks generally for reasons and is hard to distinguish semantically from xī 奚.
4. Hé 盍 "why not" is a contracted form of hé bù 何不.
