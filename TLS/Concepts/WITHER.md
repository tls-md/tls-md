# Definition
CHANGE so as to BECOME INTENSELY DRY.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for anything drying up or withering down, also anything like fish which because of lack of water starts rotting, is kū 枯 (ant. rùn 潤 "moist and lush" and róng 榮 "flourish and thrive").
2. Gǎo 槁 refers specifically to the withering of plants, or to their withered state. The combination kū gǎo 枯槁 is idiomatic.
3. Wěi 萎 (ant. shèng 盛 "rich and flourishing") refers to plants (and in a transferred usually permanent sense male sexual organs!) shrivilling up and drying out.
4. Diāo 凋 (ant. mào 茂 "be flourishing") refers to whole plants withering and losing their leaves as a result, but the word may also refer to the loss of leaved because of frost.
5. Luò 落 refers abstractly and colourlessly to trees losing their leaves.
6. Líng 零 refers in a more dramatic way to plants other than trees losing their leaves.

枯，槁
1. An important difference is that while ku1 枯 can refer more broadly to anything that dries out and rots, like fish, ga3o 槁 is more strictly restricted to the withering of trees.
