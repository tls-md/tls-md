# Definition
PUBLIC LETTER ADDRESSED to a RULER.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most general (rare) word for a memorial is shù 疏.
2. Zòu 奏 refers to the act of submission of a memorial, from Qin times onwards specifically directed to the emperor.
2. Biǎo 表 refers in Han times to a formal request for imperial support, often in matters of funeral arrangements etc.
3. Zhāng 章 refers to a memorial of thanks.
4. Yì 議 refers to formal and often controversial contribution towards the discussion of a political issue which is at issue.
5. Shū 書 "document; letter" is sometimes used to refer specifically to a memorial to the throne.

NB: The subtle distinctions between these forms of memorial are the subject of detailed discussion in Wénxīndiāolóng 文心雕龍, but the late date of this text must be kept in mind. Qǐ 啟 "expression of personal views addressed to the emperor" and zhuàng 狀 "formal accusation" are post-Han.
