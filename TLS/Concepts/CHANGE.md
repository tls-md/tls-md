# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general words for objective and typically abrupt change are biàn [[變]] "change FROM one's original state to become something different" (ant. héng [[恆]] "remain constant").
2. Huà [[化]] (ant. cháng [[常]] "remain constant") refers to irreversible change INTO a fundamentally new state, while retaining one's identity".
3. Gǎi [[改]] refers to a deliberate change brought about at a certain point in time, typically in order to improve a situation. See IMPROVE
4. Gēng [[更]] is an act of deliberately changing something, typically by replacing it by an improved version of the same kind of thing in order to insure continuity.
5. Gé [[革]] (ant. yīn [[因]] "continue the tradition") refers to a typically unlicenced act of replacing the old by something new.
6. Yì [[易]] refers prototypically to a change construed as brought about by a process of interchange and (often mutual) replacement.
7. Dòng [[動]] refers to change construed as the moving from a previous stable state.
8. Xǐ [[徙]] refers to making the object moved unstable.
9. Yí [[移]] refers to a change in a current situation so as to effect a certain development in a desired direction.
10. Yú [[渝]] is to change a current situation or an object, generally to the worse, and the word is remarkably often negated.
11. Qiān [[遷]] (ant. [[滯]] "stay put in one place, unable to move") refers typically to change of one's current condition brought about by oneself.
12. Fǎn [[反]] refers to a change resulting in the reverting to one's original state. See RETURN vt.fig

變，更，改
1. WL calls ge1ng 更 and ga3i 改 "subjective change", versus bia4n 變 "objective change".  In fact, the dominant distinction is between deliberate change brought about for a purpose on the one hand, and natural change on the other.  It ought to be mentioned that when referring to political change, bia4n 變 is highly "subjective" or as I would prefer to say "deliberate".
2. WL fails to bring out the contrast of ge1ng 更 referring to a change designed to ensure continuity, and ga3i 改 making a change in order to improve things.
