# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word primarily for something further back in time causing something later in time, but also applied to logical grounds of any kind is gù [[故]], and the image is that of a solid background against which something is happening. Both subjective reasons and objective causes are referred to by this word.
2. Yīn [[因]] is what an animate or inanimate agent bases himself on in order to develop or act, and the image is that of leaning on it.
3. Yóu [[由]] and zì [[自]] are only occasionally nominalised and metaphorically construe the ground as something from which the consequence "flows", and the image is that of a source from which an action or a process flows.
4. Yǐ [[以]] is only occasionally nominalised and construes the grounds as something used by the consequence in order for it to be established, and the image is of the use a subject makes, in the course of some action, of something else.
5. Yuán [[緣]] is construed as grounds one uses as a guideline, and yuán [[緣]] always indicates grounds used by a person, and the image is of a guideline one follows in action.
6. Jī [[機]] is an objective cause construed metaphorically as a triggering mechanism for what is caused, and the image is of a mechanism triggering an event or an action.
