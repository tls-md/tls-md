# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[DEFINITIVE/TENTATIVE]
[FIGURATIVE/LITERAL]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[PRECISE/VAGUE]
[PROSPECTIVE/RETROSPECTIVE]
1. Jì 計 refers to assessing something by a process of literal or figurative "precise calculation", and this is perhaps the most general word in this field.
[GENERAL], [PRECISE]
2. Liào 料 refers to a tentative and approximative subjective assessment, typically of probabilities.
[APPROXIMATIVE], [PROSPECTIVE], [TENTATIVE]
3. Cè 測 are to assess roughly or approximately, typically probabilities of the future, but also current matters.
[VAGUE], [TENTATIVE]
4. Lùn 論 focusses on the judgment passed explicitly by way of explicit assessment, and the word often has a theoretical or juridical flavour.
[DEFINITIVE], [EXPLICIT]
5. Liáng 量 refers very often literally to measuring physical dimensions of any kind, but can also be used figuratively to mean "fathom, imagine fully the size of something".
[LITERAL!]
6. Duó 度 is often more abstract in nuance and expresses something in the direction of a conclusive opinion about the matter assessed. Thus this meaning of duó 度 is close to the related meaning "reckon that, consider that".
[FIGURATIVE]; [[RARE]], [[MARGINAL]]
7. Chéng 程 is to apply an administrative standard in the bureaucratic assessment of something.
[DEFINITIVE], [OFFICIAL], [PRECISE]
8. Jiān 監 is to assess continuously through surveillence and the like, often through the intermediary of others.
[LASTING], [OFFICIAL], [VAGUE]
9. Chēng 稱 is primarily to assess the weight of something. See WEIGH.
10. Xiàng 相 is specifically to assess the basic inner true qualities of something on the basis of external features, as in physiognomy or the art of assessing the true quality horses by heir appearance.
[DEFINITIVE], [PRECISE], [SPECIFIC]
