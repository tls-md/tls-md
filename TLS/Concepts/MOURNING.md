**Lateinische Synonyme und Etymologien** 
GRIEF/MOURNING
dolor is a psychological concept referring to the sentiments of grief as deeply felt.
tristitia refers to the natural and often involuntary manifestation of grief in one's daily behaviour or comportment, including typically one's facial expression and bodily comportment, a morose - sometimes purly intellectual - gloominess of temporary disposition that does not necessarily invite sympathy.
moestitia refers to the natural and often involuntary manifestation of lasting an highly emotional grief. The word is close in meaning to tristitia, but possibly stonger, and the word describes a state which clearly invites sympathy in those who witness it.
moeror refers to the lively expression of dolor.
luctus is the conventional and typically ritualised public expression of grief.
