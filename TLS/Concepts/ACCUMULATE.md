# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[ABSTRACT/CONCRETE]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
[LARGE-SCALE/SMALL-SCALE]
[LASTING/TRANSITORY]
1. The current general word for accumulating anything concrete or abstract is jī [[積]] (ant. sǎn [[散]] "be dispersed"), and the word focusses on the process of accumulation rather than on the result only.
[LARGE-SCALE], [LASTING]
2. Xù [[畜]] / [[蓄]] refers specifically to accumulation and continuous storage of things for the purpose of sustenance of life or the rearing of domestic animals.
[CONCRETE], [SMALL-SCALE] [TRANSITORY]
3. Chǔ [[儲]] refers to the accumulation and continuous storage of new articles of general use for the maintainance of life.
[CONCRETE!], [TRANSITORY]
4. Lěi [[累]] typically refers quite literally to the piling up of things into a heap or a heap-like structure, but the word does occasionally have generalised usages referring to accumulation of any kind, abstract or concrete.
[CONCRETE!], [LASTING]
5. Wěi [[委]] (ant.* qì [[棄]] "throw away") refers to small-scale accumulation of concrete objects.
[CONCRETE], [SMALL-SCALE]
## Modern Chinese Criteria
積累 is the currect modern word for accumulating.
累積 is a current word with the same general meaning.
積存 refers to accumulating things for the keeping.
積聚 focussing on the collecting without special focus on one place.
聚積 focussing on the collecting in one place.
積攢 jīzǎn refers to accumulating as a mode of accumulating and saving, and the word is marginal in the group.
累
積
攢
first rough draft to identify synonym group members for future analysis, based on CL. 18.11.2003. CH/
## 
1. Some words can take abstract objects (xù 畜, jī 積, occasionally chǔ 儲 ), others are basically limited to concrete objects (jí 集, jí 輯, wěi 委, zhì 庤 ).
2. The collocation of things may be typically on a large scale (jī 積, chù 畜 ), or on a small scale (wěi 委, zhì 庤 ), or indifferently on any scale (jí 集, jí 輯 ).
3. The purpose of the collocation of things may be constant and current use (chù 畜 ), or it may typically be the creation of a large permanent collection of amassed stuff (jī 積 ), or it may be unspecified (jí 集, jí 輯 ).
