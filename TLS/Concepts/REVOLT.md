# Definition
ATTACK one's SELF:own GOVERNMENT USING VIOLENCE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for staging a revolt against authorities is pàn [[叛]] (ant. shùn [[順]] "remain loyal").
2. Luàn [[亂]] (ant. zhì [[治]] "regularly political government") refers to a major political upheaval designed to topple the reigning government.
3. Biàn [[變]] (ant. cóng [[從]] "remain politically obedient") refers rather abstractly and neutrally to large scale or comprehensive political unrest of an unspecified character without the negative evaluation of such action which is inherent in luàn [[亂]].
4. Fǎn [[反]] (ant. zhōng [[忠]] "show proper loyalty") refers to a political revolt on a lesser scale than luàn [[亂]], and this word always has negative overtones.
5. Bèi [[背]] and bèi [[倍]] (ant. shùn [[順]] "remain loyal") refer to a defiant act of disobedience and turning against one's superiors without a necessary intention to topple these authorities.
6. Nàn [[難]] (ant. xiào [[效]] "loyal positive effort") refers rather abstractly to political unrest of an unspecified character and focusses on this as being a threat to the ruler's authority and position.
7. Nì [[逆]] (ant. shùn [[順]] "remain loyal") refers to political disobedience and revolt in a disapproving way.
