# Definition
MOVE DOWN INTO WATER.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general word for the process sinking is probably chén [[沈]] (ant. fú [[浮]] "float").
2. Mò [[沒]] "get submerged" (ant. piāo [[漂]] "float") expresses the result of chén [[沈]] "sinking".
3. Lún [[淪]] "sink into" (ant. fàn [[汎]] "float") has abstract usages where the word means "go under" and gets close in meaning to wáng [[亡]] "be ruined".
4. Miǎn [[湎]] "get immersed in" is mostly used in transferred senses such as "get immersed in wine" and thus gets close in meaning to dān [[耽]] "get addicted to".
