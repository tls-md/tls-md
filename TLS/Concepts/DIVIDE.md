# Definition
CAUSE something to BECOME TWO OR MANY DIFFERENT PARTS.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general word for physically diving things into separate parts is fēn [[分]] (ant. yī [[一]] "treat as one undivided whole, to unite") and this word may refer to destroying the unity of what is being divided.
2. Bié [[別]] (ant. tóng [[同]] "treat as the same, treat the same way") is to separate physically what can be separated out without interfering with integrity of the things separated. ( [[別男女]] "separate men from women")
3. Xī [[析]] is to split and divide what is naturally unsplit and undivided.
4. Lí [[離]] (ant. hé [[合]] "combine into one") is to keep apart what naturally is apart.
