# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
[+FIGURATIVE/LITERAL]
[GENERAL/SPECIFIC]
1. Tán [[壇]] is the general word for an altar of any kind.
[GENERAL], [LITERAL]
2. Shè [[社]] "altar of the land" is one of the major religious institutions of ancient China.
[LITERAL], [SPECIFIC]
3. Jì [[稷]] "altar dedicated to the gods of grain" is mostly used in conjunction with shè [[社]] and does not, by itself, represent such an important institution in Chinese cultural history.
[LITERAL], [SPECIFIC]
4. Shè jì [[社稷]] "altars of the land and grain" is also the standard Chinese term for what we might call "the Nation" in modern English, because the essence of a state was seen to be contained in the local sacrifices undertaken at these altars of the land and grain. There is characteristic semantic oscillation between the meaning ALTAR and the meaning NATION. See NATION.
[+FIGURATIVE], [SPECIFIC]
5. Jiāo [[郊]] refers to the suburban altar in the vicinity of a city.
[LITERAL], [SPECIFIC]
## Modern Chinese Criteria
