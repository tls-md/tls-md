# Definition

# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The clearly predominant word for smiling and laughing is xiào 笑 which refers to
                any laughter, loud or quiet, kind or unkind.
2. Chī 嗤 is almost onomatopoeic and refers to noisy derisive laughter, and the word
                is exceedingly rare, missing even in SHUOWEN.
3. The rare word shěn 哂 refers to a discreet, noiseless smile.
4. Qiào 誚 refers to ridiculing someone.
5. Jī 譏 refers to deliberate articulate satire including criticism.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
