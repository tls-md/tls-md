2. Méng [[盟]] refers to a momentous formal (typically written) contract or oath of allegiance betwen feudal lords confirmed by ritual blood sacrifice, although such oaths could occasionally be taken by humble individuals (bī rén [[卑人]] "persons of low status") in which case the day of the ritual was not recorded.
3. Shì [[誓]] is sometimes used in ancient texts to refer to a sworn covenant between individuals, but the word also refers to a personal oath. See OATH.

2. Méng 盟 involves the blood of sacrificial domestic animals, shì 誓 does not normally involve the use of sacrificial animals..
3. Méng 盟 involves invocation through the blood of sacrificial animals, and it is typically in red writing, while shì 誓 is by the use of invocation of the spirits through words only, inviting the gods to punish those who break the oath. Occasionally this can be accompanied by casting a jade object into the river.
4. Shì 誓 can be an oath sworn by one individual, whereas méng 盟 is always a covenant between different parties. See CONTRACT.
