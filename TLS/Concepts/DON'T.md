COMMAND that one SHOULD NOT to ACT in a DEFINED way.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most common prohibitive particle is wù [[勿]], which usually precedes transitive verbs with omitted objects.
2. Wú [[毋]] is a prohibitive particle which normally requires that any transitive verb it precedes must retain its object.
3. Wú [[無]] appears often used for wú [[毋]], but there is a clear tendency for the word to indicate a generalised "one should not" rather than a "don't" hic et nunc.
## Modern Chinese Criteria

1. WL fails to note the cases where the transitive verbs after 勿 do have objects, and the precise conditions under which the word is NOT a prohibitive negation.
