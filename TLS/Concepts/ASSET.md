## 
1. Yè 業 derives its meaning from "to inherit", "inherited occupation". ( 業其官 "inherit an office (from one's father)" ZUO Zhao 1.12). Primarily inherited "inalienable" wealth or more abstract precious inherited property is typically yè 業; assets acquired due to one's own efforts are typically chǎn 產. We have xiān jūn zhī yè 先君之業 "the rich heritage from the former ruler" ZUO Xiang 18.4
2. Chǎn 產 can be taken away from one, apparently not yè 業. In any case we have duó chǎn 奪產 and not duó yè 奪業.
3. Chǎn 產 may be héng chǎn �痦� "constant property", but it may also be impermanent. (MENG 1A7)
4. Chǎn 產 may be fairly small or large, yè 業 is always of significant proportions.
5. Chǎn 產 is something the common people have, and which the aristocracy also has. Yè 業 is only used in elevated contexts and refers to assets of great value.
6. Yè 業 is primarily connected with the working effort of past generations, while chǎn 產 is primarily connected with one's own productivity, and is semantically linked to the notions of growth and birth.
