談，論
1. WL takes the difference between ta2n 談 and lu4n 論 to be one of formality versus informality of discussion.  In fact, lu4n 論 is not primarily dialogical in nature at all, and the word only refers to dialogue by a relatively rare extension.  Ta2n 談, on the other hand, is by no means limited to dialogue, and the distinctive feature of the word is its predominant pejorative nuance "chatter".

議，論
1. WL rightly points out that yi4 議 aims at some decision, whereas lu4n 論aims at a judgment.  One may add that the main difference here is that yi4 議 refers to a formal discussion in council, whereas lu4n 論 refers to a disquisition quite generally.
