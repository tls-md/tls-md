# Definition
DECIDE to DISCARD from one's THOUGHT.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for refusing to pay attention to something which one knows very well is wàng 忘 (ant.* gù 顧 "take into account; pay attention to" and shèn 慎 "pay careful attention to"). NB: This meaning is much more common than the other meaning "forget", where this antonym does not apply.　
2. Zhì 置 is to put aside and refuse to consider any more.
3. Qì 棄 is to reject as unworthy of one's attention and often to disregard defiantly.
