# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for the throat is hóu 喉, but the word refers more specifically to the place where one breathes.
2. Yān 咽 refers primarily to the place where the food passes at the opening of the throat.
3. Yì 嗌 can refer to the throat as the place where food passes in the process of eating or the place through which one breathes and is thus in a sense the most general word, but the word always remained rare.
## Modern Chinese Criteria
