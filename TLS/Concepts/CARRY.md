負，任，荷，擔
1. One might add to WL's description the main difference which is that fu4 負 often takes abstract objects, and re2n 任 became predominantly figurative, whereas he4 荷 and da4n 擔 are nearly always concrete.  In fact, the inclusion of the marginal re2n 任 in this series is misleading, because the relevant meaning became obsolete at an early stage of the language.
