# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general word is xiōng 胸, sometimes written xiōng 匈 and refers to the entire upper part of the torso, including the breasts, but the word is colloquial in flavour and did not become current before Warring States times.
2. Huái 懷 can be used to refer to the chest as a place where something is carried, and also as the seat of emotions.
3. Yīng 膺 is the old word referring to the outer part of the chest, the part on which clothes are placed.
4. Rǔ 乳 and the even rarer SONG colloquial word nǎi 嬭 can refer specifically to the female breasts.
5. Yì 臆 is the inner part of the chest, the seat of the emotions, and often a metaphorical term for thoughts harboured in the heart, and in early texts the word is rare, occurring mostly in the combination xiōng yì 胸臆 "the breast as seat of emotion and thought".
6. Lèi 肋 is an anatomical term for the sides of the chest and the ribs.　See RIB
