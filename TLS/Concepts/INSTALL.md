# Definition
APPOINT to an IMPORTANT RANK.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The general term for installing someone in a high position is lì 立.
2. Fēng 封 refers specifically to installing a person in an enfeoffed position.
3. Jiàn 建 primarily refers to the establishment not of a person but of the position itself; however, the word does occasionally refer to the establishment of a person in the position of a ruler.
NB: Jí wèi 即位 and the rarer as well as more elevated jiàn zuò 踐阼 refer to the act of ascending the throne, i.e. to "being installed".
