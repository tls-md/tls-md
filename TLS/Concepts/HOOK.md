# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The current general word for a hook is gōu [[鉤]], which can refer to:
a. the fishhook, mentioned for the Warring States in ZHUANGZI. Fishhooks can be made of bone or metal; bone ones are known since the Neolithic, bronze ones since the early Shang period.
b. belt-hook, which came to use in the late Western Zhou and Chunqiu period, and became common in Warring States times. It was made of bronze, iron, gold, silver, jade, or ivory; valuable pieces were richly inlaid with precious metals or turquoise.
c. the hook to hang up something; the most remarkable among this group are hooks for suspending bronze bells, which are known already from the early Chunqiu period.
d. the word can also refer to the implements and weapons with a hook or to the crooked artefacts; the term is therefore used for the ladders with a hook to climb city walls (mentioned already in SHIJING), crooked swords mentioned in HANSHU, and sickles.
