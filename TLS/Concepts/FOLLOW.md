# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The dominant current word for moving along behind someone or something else, both in concrete and in abstract senses, is cóng [[從]] (ant. bèi [[背]] "be in opposition against").
2. Suí [[隨]] is to move along literally behind someone, by a deliberate act of volition.
3. Zūn [[遵]] refers primarily to the kind of deliberate following of a path, behaviour that is motivated by respect for what one follows, but sometimes the word is also used in a more generalised way referring to a person following a certain physical guideline without any suggestion of respect for this guideline, as in MENG [[遵海而南]] "head south along the shore of the sea".
4. Xún [[循]] is to follow certain guidelines or a certain prescribed path, as a matter of prudential strategy, and typically in a rather mechanical or habitual manner.
5. Yǎn [[沿]] is to follow a physical guideline (like a river bank) in a mechanical way.
6. Hòu [[後]] and zhǒng [[踵]] is to follow literally in the footsteps of someone.
7. Tīng [[聽]] refers to the abstract notion of following advice given to one as a superior. See OBEY
8. Yì [[役]] and xùn [[徇]] are fairly rare when used as words referring to the deliberate act of becoming someone's follower or employee.
9. Xí [[襲]] refers to a mechanical course of action in conformity with some pattern.
10. Zé [[則]] refers to the following of a certain abstract principle or model person to which due attention is paid. See CONFORM
