# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most current general word for continuing to do something and also for continuing a tradition is jì 繼 (ant. jué 絕 "disrupt a tradition") which concentrates on the original thing that is being continued or made longer.
2. Xù 續 (ant. duàn 斷 "interrupt a tradition") focusses on what is being added in the lengthening process, and the dominant meaning of the word is spatial lengthening.
3. Zhuǎn 轉 is refers to continuation by alternation of the agent and is translatable as "continuing in turn".
4. Chéng 承 refers to the continuation of an abstract tradition.
5. Yè 業 refers primarily to the continuation of the trade or tradition of one's own forebears.
6. Réng 仍 focusses on the uninterrupted and continuous pursuance of an activity over a continuing period.
7. Sì 嗣, which came to mean "succeed as an heir", was used in early texts to refer to the continuation of any tradition or practice.
