# Definition
INTENSE AND OFTEN PARTIAL DESIRE to be INTIMATE with a PERSON OR to POSSESS a THING.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The clearly dominant word referring to love is ài 愛 (ant. hèn 恨 "dislike"; rarely zēng 憎 "dislike"; and wù 惡 "hate"), and this word refers both to the feelings of love and to the expression of love in loving care for another person as well as in sexual relations. (Occasionally, the word may refer to the emotional preference that a small child feels for its parents. For this meaning see PREFER.)
2. Cí 慈 (ant. xiōng 凶 "vicious") refers to loving care, prototypically by mothers for minors or their offspring. When the word refers to ordinary love, it always connotes a high degree of intensity of the caring emotion.
3. Tì 悌 refers to love between brothers, particularly the love one owes one's eldest brother, and the word is rarely extended to mean brotherly as opposed to erotic or commiserating love.
4. Xiào 孝 refers to loving respect for one's parents and ancestors in attitude and action, and is a major traditional virtue.
5. Chǒng 寵 refers to enjoying the attentions and/or affections of a superior.
6. Xìng 幸 "give sexual favours to (a subject)" and xìng yú 幸於 "enjoy the sexual favours of (a ruler) refer to love sexually expressed.
7. Bì 嬖 refers to the enjoying of favourite status with a superior, and the term often connotes sexual relations, occasionally even of the homosexual kind.
8. Mù 慕 prototypically refers to loving devotion of a distant kind, but the word is also used in a more generalised way to refer to affection.
9. Hào 好 refers to love as a matter of a strong and habitual emotional preference for something. (See PREFER)
## Modern Chinese Criteria
愛 is the general modern word for loving, and the word is much stronger than 喜歡. The objects of this love can be concrete or abstract and are often persons.
好 refers to a strong preference or predilection for something other than a concrete person.
喜愛 refers to mild fondness.
憐愛 refers to the tender love between true lovers.
心愛 focusses on the genuineness of loving affection.

疼愛 focusses on lasting intensity of love between relatives.
酷愛 refers to a kind of love that is perhaps stronger than one would wish or stronger than appropriate.
疼 refers informally to lasting intense love, mainly between relatives.
慈 (lit) refers to lasting and intense love for those within one's care.
愛慕 (lit) refers to loving admiration.
老牛舐犢 "the old buffalo licks its calf" is descriptive tender love of one's offsping.
惺惺惜惺惺 is desciptive of love between persons of superior qualities.
愛情 refers nominally and generally to the emotion of love, in a rather colourless way.
情愛 focusses on the genuineness of the emotion of love.
情意 focusses on the psychological attitude of love rather than its translation into loving action.
柔情 refers to love as a very tender and warm feeling rather than as a passion.
痴情 refers to unreasonable infatuation, typically without positive prospects.
愛戀 refers to the intense love between those who are currently in love with each other.
情網 refers to love as an entangling passion.
情 is a word that can refer indirectly to feelings of love of any kind.
春情 refers periphrastically to feelings of receptivity for love.
風情 refers to unfocussed love as randiness.
色情 refers to feelings of carnal desire.
春心 refers to a general psychological state in which one is looking for love.
春意 refers to a temporary state in which one is looking for love.
初戀 refers to first love.
愛戴 refers to loving and esteeming a respected person even more strongly than would be expressed by 敬愛.
敬愛 refers to loving and esteeming a person that does deserve such respectful love.
喜愛 focusses on the delight one takes in the concrete thing one loves properly as well one might.
愛好 refers to a passionate preference one might well have, natureally, directed not towards a person but to other abstract or concrete items.

PIETAS, AFFECTIO

5. Inter Amorem et cupidinem. Aliud est, inquit [col. 10A] Cato, Philippe, amor longe, aliudque cupido. Accessit illico alter ubi alter recessit: alter bonus, alter malus. Alii verius amorem et bonum dixerunt et malum, cupidinem semper malum. Amoris [ Al., Jam horum] quadripartita differentia est. Est enim justus amor; pius, crudelis, obscenus. Justus amor est uxorum, pius filiorum, crudelis contra naturam, ut Pasiphae, obscenus meretricum.
