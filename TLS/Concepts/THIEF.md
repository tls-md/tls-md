盜，竊，賊
1. Da4o 盜 can refer to a thief who is hired to kill, but the word does not specifically refer to a hired assassin but to a robber or thief.  The word has no standard figurative or metaphorical meanings.  Ze2i 賊 regularly refers to a hired assassins, indeed the word regularly means "to assassinate", and crimes against property are not the primary business of the ze2i 賊 "bandit, villain; foe; hired assassin", and the word is regularly used in derived figurative senses referring not even to persons but to inimical social factors.
