# Definition
ACT so as to USE WORDS FOR SHOWING MEANING.
*Speech by speaker X, directed towards audience Y, in order to communicate message Z.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most colourless and general way of referring to any act of saying attributed to any subject, no matter whether animate or inanimate, something is yuē 曰, and the verb introduces what poses as direct but can often be the summarising of such speech and even the summarising of the subject's opinion.
2. Yán 言 is to speak up, propose, typically in public, and on one's own initiative, to maintain something, and the word can indroduce direct speech as well as occasionally very limited indirect speech.
3. Yǔ 語 is to say something as part of typically informal conversation. Contrast yù 語 "tell, inform" in REPORT.
4. Tán 談 refers to informal communicative talk, sometimes but not always with some pejorative connotation.
5. Yún 云 is used of books as well as persons and tends to refer to what are typically construed as authoritative acts of saying, and the word often has to be taken figuratively as "run as follows". (Note the perfectly regular contrast 曰 / 云 in MOUZI.)
6. Wèi 謂 is to say or predicate something of someone. See also MEAN.
7. Cí 辭 is primarily an act of careful articulation and rhetorical formulation.
8. Dào 道 "speak of with authority, speak of adequately; quote" often involves quotation or especially serious discussion of important points, or the relating of important evidence.
9. Jǔ 舉 is a technical term referring to the bringing up of a subject, and the subject of this verb is always a person, not a text.
10. Chēng 稱 refers in a rather formal historian's style to the making of statements and the applying of terminology. See also NAME.

言，語
1. WL claim that the object of ya2n 言 is never a person spoken to.  In fact, ya2n yu2 言於 regularly means "speak to (a person of higher status)", and SSC records 62 instances of this.  
ZUO Xi 30.3.2 (630 B.C.); Ya2ng Bo2ju4n 479;  Wa2ng Sho3uqia1n et al. 356; tr. Watson 1989:65;  revised tr. CH 
佚之狐言於鄭伯曰： Yi4 Zhi1hu2 delared in front of the Earl of Zhe4ng:
2. In many contexts ya2n 言 is to speak up and to formally propose or suggest something, typically to a superior. Yu3 語 does not have such usages and is almost always informal.  Formal serious discussion with question and answer tends to be ya2n 言and not yu3 語.
3. WL claims that that for "proverb, saying" one generally uses yu3 語 and not ya2n 言.  SSC has over 50 examples where ya2n 言 means "saying". Zuo Zhao 27.2.3(516 B.C.) Ya2ng Bo2ju4n 1483; Wa2ng Sho3uqia1n et al.1368 tr. Legge:721
「上國有言曰： "The upper States have a saying 
『不索， that if you do not seeek for a thing 
何獲？』 you will not get it."
The special feature of the sayings ya2n 言, regularly introduced by yo3u ya2n 有言 "there is/was a saying", is that they tend to be located or even attributed as bon-mots or geflgelte Worte to a person or even an author.  Yu3 語 on the other hand is only once in SSC attributed to someone specific (the people of the state of So4ng), and the word generally tends to refer to current popular sayings even when the phrase bi3 yu3 鄙語 is not used.
4. WL compares“言”和“語”. But it remains quite unclear whether the reference is to yu3 語 or yu4 語, two very different words.  When WL talk about the nominal uses of 語 the reference must be to yu3 語, whereas when they speak of the meaning "tell" for 語 the reference is to yu4 語.  As a result the article is a complete mess.
This example shows up clearly that the method of attaching synonym discussions to words rather than to words under a given interpretation is manifestly wrong and thoroughly confusing.
