The words for China have this in common that they do NOT designate any one state. [[中國]] "the central states" is implicitly plural when it does not refer to the capital city. [[諸夏]] the various Xià (states)" is explicitly plural. The standard Imperium Romanum has no counterpart in Chinese until very late, unless one admits [[天下]] "all under Heaven" as a designation for the empire. But [[天下]] does not define any bounded empire. It remains to be seen exactly when a standard term for China was took shape. Compare the problems of finding a term for the Chinese language.
Based on [[顧頡剛]] & [[王樹民]], “ [[夏]] ” [[和]] “ [[中國]] ”— [[祖國古代的稱號]], Zhongguo lishi dili luncong, Vol. 1 (Xi'an, 1981), 6-22).
In the Shu and Shi sections relating to the early Zhou, [[區夏]] (= [[夏區]] ), [[有夏]] and [[時夏]] (= [[是夏]] ) refers to the place in which the Zhou established their capital after their conquest of Shang, in contradistinction to Zhou [[掇]] homeland in the West ( [[西土]] ) and the close Zhou allies ( [[一二邦]] ). The Zhou referred to their own domain as [[烠]] he central city-state � ( [[中國]] ). Since [[中國]] in this usage refers to the territory directly governed by the Zhou, it is singular and used in exchange with [[京師]] and in contradistinction with [[四方]] and [[四國]]. Other states also referred to their capital regions as [[啎什縕]] (thus Wu in GY 19.09.01/618); a (perhaps late) variant of this word is [[啎尹塹]] (Yugong).
After becoming strong, the states enfeoffed by Zhou asserted the community with the [[周]] by commencing to refer to themselves as [[堔]] L �, leading to the plural designation [[埣悎]] L �, used in contrast with designations like [[啈]] i [[狄]]�. The distinction between the two groups was viewed as cultural, and its precise reference shifted over time, originally excluding states (like [[楚]] ) from the community of [[諸夏]] but later including them, or including them in the beginning, whilst later excluding them (like [[秦]] ). Some of the non- [[諸夏]] states were viewed as subservient to [[諸夏]] states, others as their enemies. The membership of [[楚]] to the [[諸夏]] circle was always insecure; it was, so to speak, was"always on probation.
The [[東夏]] made up a subdivision of the [[諸夏]], including states such a [[齊]] and [[魯]].
In parallel with the [[堔]] L � appellations arose the [[埽寊]] appellations, [[埽寊]] on its own and [[埣捄寊]], and, the two words may well be cognate, the common [[埽堮]] L �.
In the Warring States period the cultural distinction gave way to a geographical distinction, and the [[中國]] states were now the state occupying the Central Plain
