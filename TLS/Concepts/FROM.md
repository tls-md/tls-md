# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. Yóu [[由]] focusses on the coming out from, and the reference is primarily to a place, but can also be to cause.
2. Zì [[自]] focusses on initiation, and the reference is primarily to a time, but can also be to a place, and to the arrangement of an abstract series.
3. Cóng [[從]] derives its meaning from "to follow", and the reference is primarily to a place, but it can also be to an origin or cause, much more rarely to a time.
4. Yú [[於]] basically means "in relation to", and one of the specific meanings is "in separative relation to, from".
5. Hū [[乎]] basically means "in relation to", and one of its rarer specific meanings is "in separative relation to, from".
6. Dào [[道]] "by way of" may refer literally to a direction, but it may also refer more abstractly to a means. See USE.
