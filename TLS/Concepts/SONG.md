謳，謠，歌
1. WL claims that o1u 謳 and ya2o 謠 refer to local folksongs when used as nouns.  But ya2o 謠 is predominantly used for children's ditties, to2ng ya2o 童謠 in pre-Buddhist times, whereas o1u 謳 is never used to refer to any such thing and refers regularly to popular work-songs as used, for example, by builders or men who milk cows, and it would appear that such songs could also be about emperors and kings.
