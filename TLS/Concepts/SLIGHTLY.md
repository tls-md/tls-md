# Definition
To a SMALL DEGREE.
# Criteria and general notes
## Old Chinese Criteria
1. The most common word for something happening on a very small scale is shǎo 少 (ant. duō 多 "a great deal").
2. Guǎ 寡 tends to focus on the excessive nuance, on something happening to a lesser degree than needed.
3. Báo 薄 (ant. hòu 厚 "intensely") focusses on something happening to a lesser degree than a conventional standard would indicate or prescribe.
