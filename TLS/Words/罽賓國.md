Kapiśa), or a reference to Jiébǐshě 劫比舍 (skr. Karpiśaya); Rémuset thinks it might refer to today's Kabul (Kophes); Lévi and Chavannes think it refers to Kaśmīra (which is maybe the most likely explanation)**) (concept::[[INDIAN PLACE NAMES]])  [((num::2))](https://hxwd.org/concept.html?concept=INDIAN%20PLACE%20NAMES#uuid-aa9cfe3b-dc78-4d62-9aab-d4dd4d49b1e1) ^uuid-aa9cfe3b-dc78-4d62-9aab-d4dd4d49b1e1
