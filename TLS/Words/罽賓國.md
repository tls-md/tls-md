- *jì bīn guó* [[TLS/Core/Syntactic functions/uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[TLS/Core/Semantic features/uuid-2e7204ae-4771-435b-82ff-310068296b6d|(sem-feat::buddhist)]]  **(BUDDH:) Ancient state north of India; it is doubtful which place this name refers to and different sources give different kinds of information (some think this is a corruption of Jiābìshìguó 迦畢試國 (skr. Kapiśa), or a reference to Jiébǐshě 劫比舍 (skr. Karpiśaya); Rémuset thinks it might refer to today's Kabul (Kophes); Lévi and Chavannes think it refers to Kaśmīra (which is maybe the most likely explanation)** [[INDIAN PLACE NAMES]]  [[uuid-aa9cfe3b-dc78-4d62-9aab-d4dd4d49b1e1|(2)]]
