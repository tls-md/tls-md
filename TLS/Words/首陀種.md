Śūdra, also referred to as shūtuóluó 輸陀羅, shǒutuó 首陀, shùdáluó 戍達羅, shùtuoluó 戍陀羅, shāshēng zhǒng 殺生種 ('the caste which kills life'), èzhǒng 惡種 ('the evil caste'). These terms refer to the very lowest caste, including slaves, butchers, etc. This class did not have the right to make offerings or engage in rituals. After death, members of the first three classes were supposed to be reborn as sentient beings whereas members of the fourth class were regarded as being incapable of being reincarnated (therefore the name yīshēng zǔ  一生祖 'one-life class').
