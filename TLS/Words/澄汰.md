This suppression of Buddhism is also referred to as Huìchāng 會昌 persecution. Chéngtài is very uncommon to refer to this event. More current is shātài 沙汰 (Huìchāng shātài 會昌沙汰, see for example ZTJ 4.103). The literary meaning of chéngtài is close to the that of shātài 'to clean away dirt and sediment'. On the suppression of Buddhism in 845 see Ch'en 1973: 226-233.** [[BANISH]]  [[uuid-61f080fe-c6d6-4a8e-ac64-855a704ee97c|(1)]]
