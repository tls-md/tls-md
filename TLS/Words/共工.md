A mythical creature of his name is often represented as having the face of a human and the body of a snake, sporting red hair and riding on two dragons. HNZ shows an extraordinary interest in this legendary figure: He was punished by Emperor Zhuanxu 顓頊 for causing flood catastrophies. [HNZ 8.8a, 15.1b] He denied the authority of the early emperors. [HNZ 1.3a, 3.1b] He is said to have been drowned by >Emperor Yao. [HNZ 19.2a] According to XUN 25 he was exiled to the Dark Island by >Emperor Yu; according to MENG 5A3 it was >Emperor Shun who exiled him. SJ 1 describes him as an arch scoundrel.** [[RULERS PREHISTORIC]]  [[uuid-f72035b3-5a6e-47e9-a035-b35a6e67e905|(1)]]
