The name derives from the procedure used to yield it. This procedure relies on the decomposition of each number into "pilings-up" of rows of the same-size. (NB: the consideration that there may be a number for which no such constellation of any kind is possible, i.e. where there can be no piling-up except of single-membership rows, does not appear to be focussed on in ancient Chinese sources. (The notion of a prime number is claimed to be present in 13th century mathematical texts.))JZ 1.6, Liu Hui's comm: 其所以相減者皆等數之重疊 "The reason why they are subtracted from each other is that they all are reiterated "pilings-up" of the equal number (i.e. the common divisor)"At JZ 2.28 comparison is between an integer and a number involving a fraction (a half), and the děngshù turns out to be a whole number. This case is puzzling and unique, and it depends on the the result of the division of the non-integer by the děngshù is another non-integer with the same added fraction.** [[NUMBER]]  [[uuid-c3317d7f-51cd-42a7-9562-b24c7663c55b|(1)]]
