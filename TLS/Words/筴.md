- *cè* [[TLS/Core/Syntactic functions/uuid-8717712d-14a4-4ae2-be7a-6e18e61d929b|n]] **bundle of bamboo strips for writing on; document; recordsbamboo or wooden strips woven together as a mat (the character 冊 depicts this). Ordinarily hemp was used for string, but silk could be used for especially valuable writings; perhaps leather ( 韋 ) was used in a similar way. On each strip were cut triangular indentations to keep the string in place. It was common to have two or three strings ( 編, 道 ). The last strip served as a center around which the 冊 was wrapped. On the back of the first strip the title of the 冊 could be written. Each strip could have a serial number. 冊 and 策 appear to be used interchangably, except that wheras 策 is a general word for strips of any length women in the above way, 策 (cf. its original meaning of "whip") is preferably made of rather long strips. 冊 is not used for counting written material.
