It became extremely influential for East Asian Buddhism from the fifth century onwards; on the text see GRONER 1990). In addition there are the threefold pure precepts (sānjù jìngjiè 三聚淨戒 ); see MULLER. For an authorative study of these precepts see GROOT 1893.** [[FORBID]]  (1) ^uuid-d76aad01-4f23-4c08-8078-cae0ac4a61ac
