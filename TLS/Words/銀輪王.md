Muller: 'In pre-Buddhist Indian tradition, this refers to a sage, benevolent and capable ruler, who eminently handles the domain; somewhat of an ideal, mythical vision of the perfect king, who is able to rule by righteousness rather than by force. In Buddhism, a special meaning is implied, with this ruler possessing a buddhas enlightenment and abilities. In particular, there are four kings, who possess gold, silver, bronze and iron wheels respectively.' (SANSKRIT cakravarti-rāja). The Gold wheel-turning king (Jīn-lún wáng 金輪王) is the highest of these kings.**) (concept::[[BUDDHIST DEITIES]])  [((num::1))](https://hxwd.org/concept.html?concept=BUDDHIST%20DEITIES#uuid-dd7f9731-f802-4ef6-9e10-07c8c4c6ddcb) ^uuid-dd7f9731-f802-4ef6-9e10-07c8c4c6ddcb
