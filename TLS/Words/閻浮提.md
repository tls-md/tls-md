Sumeru. Only this continent was thought of being in possession of a 'Diamond-seat' (jīngāng zuò 金剛座) which is the place where all Bodhisattvas gain enlightenment.** [[BUDDHIST REGIONS]]  [(6)](https://hxwd.org/concept.html?concept=BUDDHIST REGIONS#uuid-9a2e82bf-c289-42e3-a187-69b88b0e0dfe) ^uuid-9a2e82bf-c289-42e3-a187-69b88b0e0dfe
