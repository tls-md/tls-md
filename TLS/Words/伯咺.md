He is first mentioned in ZUO Yin 5 for his participation in the defence of the state of Zheng against an attack from Wei 魏. In spite of his military merits in the defence of Zheng for the years 718 and 707, he is accused of lack of loyalty by >Duke Li of Zheng 鄭厲公 (reigned 701-697 and 680-673) in connection with the latter’s return to power in 680, and he is made to commit suicide in the same year.
