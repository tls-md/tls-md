When King Huiwen appointed Zhang Yi prime minister, Chen Zhen fled to the state of Chu where he advised >King Huai of Chu 楚懷王 (r. 328 - 299) not to be duped by Zhang Yi. Later he rejoined the state of Qin. When King Huiwen of Qin was planning to come to the rescue of HF’s home state of Han, Chen Zhen successfully advised against this. [ZGC 26.16 (ed. Shanghaiguji p. 960)] SJ 46.1896 has a long dialogue between Chen Zhen (under the name Tian Zhen 田軫) and >Su Dai 蘇代 (late 4th century).
