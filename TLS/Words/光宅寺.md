This probably refers to a monastery situated in Cháng'ān which was built in 677. There is also a more famous monastery of the same name which was built in 502 by Emperor Wǔ 武 of Liáng 梁, situated in today's Nánjīng 南京. The name derives from light-rays (guāng 光) which supposedly were ejected from a Guānyīn 觀音 statue for a period of seven days (see Foguang: 2171-2172).**) (concept::[[MONASTERIES]])  [((num::1))](https://hxwd.org/concept.html?concept=MONASTERIES#uuid-73428d24-eedd-4cdf-9cb0-883f2b87c9f3) ^uuid-73428d24-eedd-4cdf-9cb0-883f2b87c9f3
