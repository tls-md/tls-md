However, her husband was not yet following the Buddha's teaching and he was struck by misfortune and illness. This was at the time when the Buddha had ascended to a heaven in order to preach to his mother there. His ministers thereupon used the 栴檀 wood (sandal-wood) from a mountain called Niútóu 牛頭 and fabricated a small Buddha-statue five 尺. Thereupon the king recovered from his illness. It is said that this event initiated the construction of small Buddha-statues in India, a habit which was eventually transmitted to China.)**) (concept::[[INDIAN PROPER NAMES]])  [((num::1))](https://hxwd.org/concept.html?concept=INDIAN%20PROPER%20NAMES#uuid-2e1f1e8c-5fd3-44f1-8f30-977400274b6a) ^uuid-2e1f1e8c-5fd3-44f1-8f30-977400274b6a
