Tuṣita Heaven, pali Tusita Heaven (other translations of the Sanskrit term include Dōushuài-tiān 兜率天, Dōushù-tiān 兜術天, Dōushuàituó-tiān 兜率陀天, Dōushuàiduō-tiān 兜率多天, Dōushītuó-tiān 兜師陀天, Dūshǐduō-tiān 都史多天, Dūshǐduō-tiān 都駛多天; Zhīzú-tiān 知足天, Miàozú-tiān 妙足天, Xǐzú-tiān 喜足天, Xǐlè-tiān 喜樂天. This refers to the fourth heaven among the six heavens of the world of desire (yùjiè 欲界), situated in between the Yèmó-tiān 夜摩天 and Lèbiànhuà-tiān 樂變化天. The Tuṣita heaven is supposed to have two palaces and the inner palace is the dwelling place of a Bodhisattva in his last stage, just before being born as a Buddha (bǔchù púsà 補處菩薩). According to Buddhist cosmology, the current resident is Maitreya (i.e. the next Buddha after Śākyamuni) who is supposed to spend 4,000 years in this heaven before being born as a human being)** [[BUDDHIST REGIONS]]  [[uuid-d209a3cf-3355-441c-a974-ac6f0bc38ad2|(4)]]
