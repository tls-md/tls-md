It is situated at the top of Mt. Sumeru and in the four directions there are eight heavenly cities each.; the city where the above god resides is called 善見城 or 喜見城. All in all there are 33 places in this heaven, called 三十三天. These places are mentioned and described in 正法念處經, fasc. 25. The description of this heaven is quite popular in Indian sūtra literature since the mother of Buddha was said to have been reborn there after her death, and Buddha ascended to this heaven in order to preach the dharma for his mother for 3 months.
