Bo Lizi was repeatedly resold (百里奚轉鬻), as HNZ 19.3b puts it memorably. SJ 83.2743 reports that he was a beggar until he was brought into politics by Duke Mu of Qin 秦穆公 (r. 659 - 621). He sold himself for for five sheep-skins to Duke Mu of Qin according to HSWZ 7.6.  SJ 39.1653 has him in conversation with Duke Mu of Qin. A remarkable case of social mobility in ancient China, he became a reform-minded prime minister who helped that duke dominate the neighbouring states. [HNZ 10.11b] He is often mentioned on a par with >Guan Zhong 管仲 (d. 643) who played a similar role in the service of >Duke Huan of Qi 齊桓公.** [[MALES OF CHU]]  (1) ^uuid-2a3561f1-76b0-4b41-b561-f176b0fb4168
