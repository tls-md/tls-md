BUDDH: transformation through magic, illusionary transformation (this word often appears as a metaphor in Buddhist texts. The world as we perceive it is nothing but an illusion and the constituents of existence appear in it conditioned by many factors interdependent of each other. However, since all constituents of existence are in reality empty, their appearance is false, comparable to the show of a magician)
