Prince Mùyí 公子目夷 (7th century) was a son by a concubine of Duke Huan of Song 宋桓公 (r. 681-651), and Duke Huan wanted to establish him as a successor. He was said to have declined the offer of the throne in 642. [HSWZ 10.7] The story is also related in SY 4.8 and ZUO Xi 6] In ZUO Xi 21, Prince Muyi unsuccessfully recommends to Duke Xiang of Song 宋襄公 (r. 650 – 637) to attack the Chu army as it is crossing a river, and this episode is briefly referred to in SY 8.2 (ed. Wang Ying p. 314).
