happen to V, by chance, have the opportunity to (the V is usually a positive event: be so fortunate to V; but sometimes also neutralized) The word expresses that an action happens by coincidence. It probably originated during the Tang dynasty and is quite common in ZTJ. In BIANWEN there is also one example of the reduplicated form of the word qiàqià 恰恰 : 峻嶺高嶺總安致，恰恰偏布不容針。 (WANG ZHONGMIN 1957: 370). There is also one example of qiàhǎo 恰好 in ZTJ (ZTJ 3.079; WU: 242: 有僧問： “ 十二中時如何據驗？ ” 師云： “ 恰好據驗。 ”)
