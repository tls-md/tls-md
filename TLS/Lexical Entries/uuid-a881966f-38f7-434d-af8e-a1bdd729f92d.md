BUDDH: state of neither perception nor non-perception, meditative state where there are no objects anymore, but still also no non-presence of objects. In the formless realm (wúsèjiè 無色界) this is the highest state and thus the highest form of existence in the three realms. However, a very subtle kind of thought is remaining and therefore this state is not identical with nirvāṇa; also referred to as the fourth heaven in the formless realm (see also 非想非非想處); skr. naiva-saṃj%nā-nāsaṃjnā-āyatana; PALI neva-sa%n%nā-nāsa%n%nā-āyatana
