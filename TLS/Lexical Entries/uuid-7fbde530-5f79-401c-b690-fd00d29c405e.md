# [[召問]] *[[zhāo wèn]]*  [[uuid-98f2ce75-ae37-4667-90ff-f418c4aeaa33|VPtoN]] [[uuid-31c93b3c-acc5-437d-a8b9-7cc6c5dadf04|N=topic]] [[SUMMON]]
summon the contextually determinate person to ask about the subject matter N2 [[NB: this presents an exquisite problem of syntactic analysis because 召 alone really serves as an vt(oN), but this can only come out in the analysis of the construction of this word. In principle, I fear under the present TLS synstem one would have to deny that this is a genuine case of the resultative combination 召問. The construction is 召，問其故 etc.]]
