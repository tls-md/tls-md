BUDDH: be unproduced, be unborn (this is a very important term in Mahāyāna scritpures: since the nature of all constituents of existence are fundamentally empty, they are also not subject to arising and vanishing; the popularity of the term can be also traced to Nāgārjuna's Mādhyamaka-kārikās where he postulates an eightfold negation which begins with the phrase 'unborn', 'uncreated' (anutpāda); the term is sometimes used nearly syn. with śūnyata (kōng 空) and advaya ('nonduality', bùèr 不二); skr. anutpanna, anutpāda-anirodha
