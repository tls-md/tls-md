# [[楚厲王]] *[[chù lì wáng]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[RULERS OF CHU]]
King Lì of Chǔ 楚厲王 is a Western Zhou time figure who comes up twice in HF, but who is not mentioned elsewhere in our main historical sources concerning the period. It has been surmised that the name may be a posthumous appellation for King Fenmao of Chu 楚蚡冒王 (reigned 757 -740). But this adds little to our understanding of the HF text.
