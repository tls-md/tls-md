Chén Zhěn 陳軫 (late 4th century), also referred to as Tian Zhen 田軫, is said in ZGC to have served under >King Huiwen of Qin 秦惠文王 (r. 337 -311), together with the famous itinerant diplomatist >Zhang Yi 張儀 (d. 309 or 312). When King Huiwen appointed Zhang Yi prime minister, Chen Zhen fled to the state of Chu where he advised >King Huai of Chu 楚懷王 (r. 328 - 299) not to be duped by Zhang Yi. Later he rejoined the state of Qin. When King Huiwen of Qin was planning to come to the rescue of HF’s home state of Han, Chen Zhen successfully advised against this. [ZGC 26.16 (ed. Shanghaiguji p. 960)] SJ 46.1896 has a long dialogue between Chen Zhen (under the name Tian Zhen 田軫) and >Su Dai 蘇代 (late 4th century). [ZGC passim]
