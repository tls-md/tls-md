sit NB: DUAN YUCAI 399 IS EXEMPLARY IN HIS EXPLANATION OF MODES OF SITTING. THE ORACLE BONE CHARACTER FOR 居 DEFINITELY REFERS TO SQUATTING AND NOT KNEELING. SHUOWEN DEFINES 居蹲也, THE SHUOWEN CHARACTER FOR 居 WHICH HAS 几 FOR 古 AND MEANS "STAY IN, LIVE IN" WAS LATER CONFLATED WITH THE ORACLE BONE CHARACTER WHICH THUS CAME TO HAVE TWO MEANINGS: 1. SIT, SQUAT; 2. STAY; AND THE LATTER HAS COME TO PREVAIL.
