                     / ►►▲► The thought,1 how could one2 bear it?3----1The nominal use of sī 思 "emotionally intense thought" is not unproblematic.  One might wish to argue that "when one thinks of it" is quite adequate in the context as a way of construing the word.  Cases of this sort are important not only for syntactic theory: they do make a difference to parallelistic interpretation.2Cao is impersonal: "I cannot bear it" is what he conveys, but in that impersonal mode which at the same time involves an appeal to the reader:  "surely it cannot be borne with".3Cao reflects on his own attitude to what he describes.  Playfully, I think, he goes on to elaborate on the ancient poem where people are "sighing".  He simply cannot bear the separation.  Dù Yù 杜預  comments on Zuǒzhuàn that: 不支，不能相支持也。"Bù zhī means 'cannot sustain it, live with it."[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR4h0001_tls_042-8a.10)
