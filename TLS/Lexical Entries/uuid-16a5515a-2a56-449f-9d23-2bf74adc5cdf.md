# [[婆]] *[[pó]]*  [[uuid-c086c9bd-8ec5-463f-9803-c938c8b0d4d9|ppostadS]] [[uuid-ff53e5da-89f7-4601-ae05-d2119e933dfa|rhetorical question]] [[FINAL PARTICLES]]
this is an extremely rare sentence final particle (discovered by Seishi Karashima in the BINAIYE), in ZTJ it appears two times and is used quite differently from the examples in BINAIYE, in ZTJ it rather seems to function like Modern Mandarin final 吧
