# [[伯嚭]] *[[bó mò，bà pǐ]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[MALES OF CHU]]
Bó Pĭ 伯嚭 (died 473), mostly referred to as Grand Steward Pi 太宰嚭, was appointed by >King He Lü of Wu 吳闔閭王 to the position of a Grand Steward. He came from the competing sourthern state of Chu, but he was instrumental in planning attacks by Wu on Chu [ZUO Ding 4], mainly under King He Lü’s successor, >King Fuchai of Wu 吳王夫差 (r. 495 - 473). MO 3 refers to Bo Pi’s great influence on King Fuchai. Bo Pi participated in the many miliatary conflicts between Wu and Yue. ZUO Ai 7 reports a conversation in which the Grand Stewart Pi summons >Ji Kangzi 季康子, speaks with great authority to him, and attacks Confucius’s wealthy disciple >Zigong 子貢, then in the employment of >Ji Kangzi 季康子, for respectlessness. After a heavy defeat of Wu by the the other competing southern state of Yue, Bo Pi was killed by >King Gou Jian of 越王勾踐, in 473. LIJI 4.2.22 refers to his reputation for eloquence. LScQ 18.2 passes the judgement that his bad advice lead to the ruin of King Fuchai. [ZUO Ai 12, Ai 13, Ai 15, Ai 24; LSCQ 22.6, 23.3] [Fang Zhaohui 2002: 1062-71]
