Biàn Suí 卞隨 (late Xia dynasty), along with >Wu Guan 務光, was said to have been a recluse of the end of the Xia dynasty. [SJ 61.2121] Bian Sui is said to have refused to accept the offer to become the ruler of the new Shang dynasty and to have drowned himself in the River Ying 潁 to escape the attentions of the Xia leadership.
