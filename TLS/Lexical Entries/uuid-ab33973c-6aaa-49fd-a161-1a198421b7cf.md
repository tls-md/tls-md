# [[鉤]] *[[gōu]]*  [[|n]] [[HOOK]]
hook used in angling, fishing hook
 - [[陸機集十一卷]] 若游魚銜**鉤**而出重淵之深； / as when a darting fish, with the hook in its gills, leaps from a deep lake;[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH2b1575_CHANT_001-3a.15)
 - [[淮南子]] 終不盜刀**鉤** / par la suite, on ne vola même plus de couteaux ni d'agrafes. [The English gets the subject right: "he would not steal", but 終"to the end of his life" does not here mean "in the end" and HYDCD defines: 刀鉤: 小利，which is at the opposite end of "emoluments". 陳廣忠 misconstrues the subject which in the present argument must be Confucius who - in one action - demonstrates what characterises his whole life, just as Xu You does below: 百姓最后连刀钓也没有偷窃的；Pomeranceva has gets the point  idiomatically: и никогда не брал даром ни гроша.[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR3j0010_tls_013-27a.34)
