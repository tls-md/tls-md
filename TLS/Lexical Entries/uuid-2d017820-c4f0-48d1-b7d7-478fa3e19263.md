 - [[天中記]] 如醴如酪。大略如彼，其實過之。**若**離本枝，一日而色變， / like sweet wine, and like sweet and sour rice sauce. By and large it is like that, but in reality it is more than that. Once it leaves the twig on which it is hanging, then on the first day its colour will change.[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH7x2046_CHANT_052-188a.11)
