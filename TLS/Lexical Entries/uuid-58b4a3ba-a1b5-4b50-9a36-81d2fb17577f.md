BUDDH: joy; pleasure (in some Buddhist contexts it can also be interpreted as a basis of delusion; sometimes used syn. with lè 樂 but lè is often interpreted as joy deriving from the five senses whereas xǐ is joy deriving through the process of discrimination of the mental (sixth) consciousness (MULLER). As a technical term xǐ is a rendering of SANSKRIT su-manas, defined as one of the five sensations (shòu 受) and sometimes as one of the twenty two roots (xǐgēn 喜根). According to the Āpídámójù-shělùn 阿毘達磨俱舍論 at the first and second level of meditation the (rather crude) sensation of joy emerges. At the third level this sensation is transformed in the more subtle lè 樂. In many Buddhist scriptures xǐ (especially in the compound huānxǐ 歡喜) is associated with the feeling which is produced when listening to the Buddha掇 teaching. In addition, xǐ occasionally refers to the first stage in the development of a Bodhisattva (huānxǐ dì 歡喜地)
