Gōng Zhīqí 宮之奇 (fl. 658). A courtier in the small state of Yú 虞, whose advice to appease the much larger state of Jin 晉 and allow them right of way through Yu territory went unheeded in a famous episode. The result was the destruction of the state of Yú 虞 at the hands of neighbouring much larger state of Jin 晉.This famous episode occurred in 658 and is reported in lively detail in ZUO Xi 5. [MENG 5A9; GULIANG Xi 4; XUN 32; LSCQ 15.4, 22.5, ZGC passim]
