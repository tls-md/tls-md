# [[緣覺]] *[[yuán jué]]*  [[uuid-a8e89bab-49e1-4426-b230-0ec7887fd8b4|NP]] [[BUDDHAS]]
BUDDH: self-enlightened one; one enlightened through causation; SANSKRIT pratyeka-Buddha, referring to somebody who has reached enlightenment by himself (attained alone and without a (Buddhist) teacher); in Mahāyāna texts often described as a realization of an inferior kind and contrasted to the altruistic practice of Bodhisattva (sometimes also referring to Buddha Śākyamuni and his realization of the principle of dependent co-arising, representing Buddha right after his experience of enlightenment and prior to his first sermons given at Benares)
