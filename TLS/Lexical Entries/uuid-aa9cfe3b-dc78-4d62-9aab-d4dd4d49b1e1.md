# [[罽賓國]] *[[jì bīn guó]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[uuid-2e7204ae-4771-435b-82ff-310068296b6d|buddhist]] [[INDIAN PLACE NAMES]]
(BUDDH:) Ancient state north of India; it is doubtful which place this name refers to and different sources give different kinds of information (some think this is a corruption of Jiābìshìguó 迦畢試國 (skr. Kapiśa), or a reference to Jiébǐshě 劫比舍 (skr. Karpiśaya); Rémuset thinks it might refer to today's Kabul (Kophes); Lévi and Chavannes think it refers to Kaśmīra (which is maybe the most likely explanation)
