BUDDH: hero > zealous disciple, person who presses forward unceasingly (the term 丈夫 and 大丈夫 were the subject of ardent discussions during the Song in Chán Buddhist circles; defined as somebody who is brave, tough, and persues his aims rigorously and without hesitation; for an excellent discussion of this term and the ideal of heroism and its relevance also for female practicioners in Zen Buddhism see LEVERING 1992)
