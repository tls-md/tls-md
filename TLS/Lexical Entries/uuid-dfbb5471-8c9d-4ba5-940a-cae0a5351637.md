BUDDH: the Four Heavenly Kings, the Kings of the four Heavenly regions; (the attendents of Indra; described as protecting the Buddha and his teaching); skr. Cāturmahārājika; pali CātummahārājikaThe notion of the kings of the four heavens is connected to Buddhist cosmology. According to Buddhism, the universe is divided into three parts: the world of desire (yùjiè 欲界 ), the world of form (sèjiè 色界 ), and the world of formlessness (wúsè jiè 無色界 ) (see sānjiè 三界 ). The world of form is inhabited by the lowest forms of existence, i.e. residents in hell, hungry ghosts, animals, one kind of demons, and human beings. There are six kinds of heavens in the world of desire, the first one is the dwelling place of the four kings. According to some Buddhist scriptures the four kings reside halfway up Mt. Sumeru, each living on one of those four side peaks. Their duty is to protect the four directions of the world and its continents. (According to Buddhist cosmology the four directions (continents) are called Dōngshèngshén-zhōu 東勝神洲, Nánshànbù-zhōu 南贍部洲, Xīniúhuò-zhōu 西牛貨洲, Běijùlú-zhōu 北具盧洲 )
