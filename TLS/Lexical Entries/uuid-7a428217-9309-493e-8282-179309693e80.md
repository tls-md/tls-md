 - [[陸機集十一卷]] 於是沈辭**怫**悅，
                     / 於是 "At this high pitch of excitement...". *沈 is figurative "sunken> obsolete, long forgotten".   *We have to believe the old commentators that the binome 怫悅 "make their difficult appearance"refers to the "difficulty of emergence" of these phrases. The phrase does not recur elewhere in the literature. It has remained a hapax legomenon.[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH2b1575_CHANT_001-3a.14)
