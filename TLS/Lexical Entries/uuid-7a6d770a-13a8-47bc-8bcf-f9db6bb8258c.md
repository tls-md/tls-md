BUDDH: the kalpa of emptiness (this refers to the fourth phase within a kalpa, the period after a universe has been destroyed and before a new universe is created; during this period all sentient beings of the realm of form (色界) and realm of desire (欲界) are extinguished, and everything is completely void except the fourth dhyāna heaven, 第四禪天); see also 四劫
