place of birth, native place (This word is another example of a Buddhist term which became part of the colloquial language. The term originally referred to the preconditions for one's rebirth which were determined during the period of fourty nine days after one's death. By extension the word developed the more general meaning 'place of birth; native place' in the colloquial language of the Tang and Song)
