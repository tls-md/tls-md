Cài Shū 蔡叔 (11th century), often referred to as 蔡叔度, one of >King Wen of Zhou’s 周文王 ten sons [BHT 30, no. 206, see also LNZ 1.9.6] is often mentioned together with his elder brother >Guan Shuxian 管叔鮮. [SHU 37 gives details on his supposed career.] Cai Shu was enfeoffed in Cai by his next-eldest brother >King Wu of Zhou 周武王 as a reward for his support in the campaign against the last emperor of the Shang dynasty. After King Wu’s death around 1043, Cai Shu conspired with Guan Shu and Wu Geng 武更, son of >Di Xin 帝辛, the fallen King Zhòu of Shang 商紂王, in an effort to restore the Shang dynasty. [SJ 3.109] Cai Shu was exiled by the >Duke of Zhou 周公 [HNZ 11] and died in exile. However, his feof was transferred to his son so that his family continued to rule in the state of Cai 蔡.
