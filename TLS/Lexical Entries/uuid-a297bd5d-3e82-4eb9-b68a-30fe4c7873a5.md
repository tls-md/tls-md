(BUDDH:) City of skr. Kapilavastu; pali Kapilavatthu; the full name of the city is Jiāpíluówèi 迦毘羅衛 (other phonetic transcriptions include Jiābǐluópósùdǔ 迦比羅皤L堵, Jiāpíluópósūdū 迦毗羅婆蘇都, Pódōushìchìsōu 婆兜釋翅搜, etc.). The name of the birthplace of Buddha is derived from the Immortal Jiāpíluó 迦毗羅 who was supposed to have lived there. Towards the end of Buddha's life his clan was nearly eradicated through the attack of a neighbouring state and the city became deserted. When Fǎxiǎn 法顯 visited the place during the Jin dynasty there were only a few people living there (the city is for example mentioned in LONG AGAMA, fasc. 2; FOBEN XINGJI JING0, fasc. 7)
