# [[伯樂]] *[[bó mò，bà lè luò，liáo]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[ARISTOCRATS OF QIN]]
Bó Lè 伯樂 (1) (7th century), whose real name was Sūn Yáng 孫陽, was an exemplary horse specialist in ancient China. [XUN 12.159; HNZ 2.9a, 9.22b, 11.13b] He is reported to have been a minister at the court of of Duke Mù of Qín 秦穆公 (r. 659 - 621). [HNZ 12.12b] But the context of his story in HF would actually place Bo Le around 500. Thus HF is taken to refer to another Bo Le (2) (fl. 500), also a specialist in the adjudication of horses, who was a driver for >Zhao Jianzi 趙簡子 (fl. 517-475). Stories about Bó Lè abound throughout Warring States literature, and it often remains unclear which of the two is being referred to. His name has tended to become a generic designation for specialists in the adjudication of horses, and indeed for professional specialists. LSCQ 9.5 commends Bo Le for his complete specialisation and concentration on horsemanship. [HSWZ 7.6; CC 8; ZHUANG 9; LSCQ 25.4]
