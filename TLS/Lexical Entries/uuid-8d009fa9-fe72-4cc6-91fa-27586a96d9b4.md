take up (i.e. orally cite) (a contextually defined N which usually refers to a previously stated question or problem) and say/ask (nián seems to be used quite technically by Zen historians in order to mark a break in the narrative: a certain case/problem of discussion is cited orally to a master and a commentary is expected)
