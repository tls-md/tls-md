make distinctions BUDDH: discriminate (falsely); in the Buddhist context the compound word nearly always has a negative connotation (referring to making distinctions during the process of perception and thus creating a dualistic world-view, in which one discrimates between self and others, subject and object, etc.; as such one does not see things as they really are, i.e. in their state of thusness; in the Zen context fēnbié is often described as one of the main obstacles to enlightenment); SANSKRIT vikalpa, vibhajya
