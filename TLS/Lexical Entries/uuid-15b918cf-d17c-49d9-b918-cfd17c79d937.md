# [[鮑叔]] *[[bào shū]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[ARISTOCRATS OF QI]]
Bào Shūyá 鮑叔牙 (fl. 686-685), also referred to as Bao Shu 鮑叔was an admirer and a friend [HNZ 12.28a] of >Guan Zhong 管仲, and he made the selfless recommendation in Guan Zhong’s favour to the newly appointed >Duke Huan of Qi 齊桓公. Guan Zhong was deeply grateful to him. Bào Shūyá figures prominently as a selflessly competent adviser in GUAN and elsewhere in the literature. HNZ 20.25b records his important contribution to the rise of Duke Huan to political hegemony. [ZUO Zhuang 8 and 9; Zhao 13; XUN 21; GUAN passim.]
