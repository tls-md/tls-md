what one likes or dislikes
 - [[陸機集十一卷]] 妍蚩**好惡**，
                     / 妍蚩 is poetic and obsolescent. *好惡 hàowù "what one likes and dislikes" offers EPEXEGETIC "relief" to what precedes, and the inverse word order 好惡妍蚩 would be unacceptable. Both phrases are nominalised.[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH2b1575_CHANT_001-1a.7)
