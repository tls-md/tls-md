 - [[天中記]] 如醴如**酪**。大略如彼，其實過之。若離本枝，一日而色變， / like sweet wine, and like sweet and sour rice sauce. By and large it is like that, but in reality it is more than that. Once it leaves the twig on which it is hanging, then on the first day its colour will change.[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH7x2046_CHANT_052-188a.11)
 - [[禮記]] 以為醴**酪**， / They produced must and sauces.[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR1d0052_tls_009-6a.8)
