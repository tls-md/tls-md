# [[渠]] *[[qú]]*  [[uuid-74ace9ce-3be4-452c-8c91-2323adc6186f|npro]] [[uuid-c261ea2f-9cf6-41a8-9ea5-834a8b1b63e5|dialect]] [[THIRD PERSON PRONOUNS]]
he/she/it This third person pronoun originated in the south and already appeared in texts from the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties periods (SANGUOZHI, however, examples prior to the Tang are rare; in ZTJ it appears ca. 40 times and it also can be found in YOUXIANKU where it is often suffixed with jiā 家). After the Yuan it only survived in a number of southern dialects as for example the Wú 吳 dialect and in Cantonese. According to LV SHUXIANG the pronoun is possibly related to pronoun qí 其.
