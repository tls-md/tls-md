 - [[孟子]] 雖**此**此霸王不異矣。 / but even if then(, as a consequence of this the ruler of Qi) had become nothing less than a (supremely moral and virtuous) supreme hegemon king (ancient style), [趙歧：雖用此臣位而輔君行之亦不異於古霸王之君矣。Jiao Xun has no helpful comment on 霸王. 不異 has dozens of pre-Han examples, none of them in the meaning "be not surprising". Zhu Xi's gloss to that effect is problematic.  Zhao Qi may be preferable. The historical connection of this with the preceding 3.1 is worth exploring.][HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR1h0001_tls_003-7a.5)
