the passing of things
 - [[陸機集十一卷]] 遵四時以歎**逝**，
                     / 遵 is to "feel and follow with" (unlike 從) *以 "and so" introduces a consequence of the 遵－ing with that poetic empathy. 歎 is psychologial: "be moved to sighs".[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH2b1575_CHANT_001-2a.4)
