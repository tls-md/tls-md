BUDDH: the Seperate Teaching; Muller: "(3) The 'separate teaching of the Single Vehicle. Transcendent aspect of the single vehicle, that completely transcends the three- vehicle view. This teaching is eventually encompassed in the 'same teaching of the Single Vehicle' tóngjiào yīshèng 通教一乘. This teaching is elucidated in the Huayan jing."
