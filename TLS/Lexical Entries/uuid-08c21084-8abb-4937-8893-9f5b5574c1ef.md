 - [[古列女傳]] 為梟**鴟**鴟 / [HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH1c0897_CHANT_007-1a.58)

 - [[淮南子]] **鴟**鴟目大而眎不若鼠 / Now, the eyes of the owl are large, but its vision does not compare with that of the rat;the feet of the millipede are numerous, but its speed does not compare with that of a snake.With things, it is certainly true that there are instances in whichbeing large does not compare with being small,or being numerous does not compare with being few.When it comes tothe strength within weakness and the weakness within strength,the danger within safety and the survival within destruction,if not for a sage, who could see it! Greatness or smallness, honor or disgrace, [alone] do not suffice for an assessment to be made. Only the Way that resides in each is to be valued. How can I clarify this point?[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR3j0010_tls_013-39a.2)
