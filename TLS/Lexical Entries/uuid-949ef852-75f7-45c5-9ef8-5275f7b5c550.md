                     / 若 lays out explicitly the figurative mode in the last line. *游 is an empty epithet, like that in 飛鳥 which does not refer to "flying birds" but to birds prone to flying, capable of flying, but in the case at hand possible perching somewhere. *[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH2b1575_CHANT_001-3a.15)
