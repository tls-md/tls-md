Cāngjié 蒼頡/倉頡 (legendary) was regarded as the inventor of writing in China. SHIBEN claims he was a senior minister under the legendary >Yellow Emperor himself. He is said to have been endowed with four eyes and supreme wisdom. The traditions concerning him are judiciously presented in F. Bottéro, “Cang Jie and the invention of writing. Reflections on the elaboration of a legend”, in Halvor Eifring and Christoph Anderl, eds., Festschrift Christoph Harbsmeier, p. 135-155.
