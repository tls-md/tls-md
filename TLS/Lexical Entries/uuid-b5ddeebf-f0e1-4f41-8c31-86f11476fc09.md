BUDDH: dharma-medicine (in Buddhist scriptures the Buddha-dharma is occasionally metaphorically described as 'medicine' since it saves people from suffering; see for example Guàndǐng jīng 灌頂經, T.21: 532c21-23; the section in this scripture deals with the Buddha Yàoshī Liúlíguāng Rúlái 藥師琉璃光如來 who, at the time when he was practicing as Bodhisattva, made twelve vows. The term fǎ-yào appears in the seventh vow: 第七願者。[...]若有苦惱無救護者。我為此等攝大法藥。令諸疾病皆得除愈。無復苦患至得佛道.('The seventh vow: '[...] if there are any [beings] who are afflicted by suffering, not saved and protected, I will apply the great dharma-medicine for them and cause all sicknesses to be healed, so that they will not be suffering again until they attain the Way of the Buddha.')
