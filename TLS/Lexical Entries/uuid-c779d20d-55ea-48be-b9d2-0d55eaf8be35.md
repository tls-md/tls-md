 - [[孟子]] 雖由**霸王**王不異矣。 / but even if, as a consequence of this the ruler of Qi had become nothing less than a (supremely moral and virtuous) supreme ruler ancient style, [雖用此臣位而輔君行之亦不異於古霸王之君矣。Jiao Xun has no helpful comment on 霸王. 不異 has dozens of pre-Han examples, none of them in the meaning "be not surprising".
