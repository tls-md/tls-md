what (this question word appeared during the Tang and can be found on some Dunhuang manuscripts and texts from the Tang period; it is identical in function with the earlier 是 'what' as well as with 什 'what' which appeared somewhat later, 是, 甚,什 seem to be different transliteration of the same colloquial phonem; 是, 甚,什 gradually replaced 何 from the Six Dyn. period onwards; 甚 is rarely used in compound words: 甚沒 (BLZ), 甚物, 甚謨 (Stein 2669), 甚生 (Tang, Bianwen), 甚摩 (Five Dyn.), 甚麼 (early Song))
