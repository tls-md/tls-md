# [[蚩尤]] *[[chī yóu]]*  [[uuid-8717712d-14a4-4ae2-be7a-6e18e61d929b|n]] [[DEITIES]]
Chìyóu 蚩尤 was said to be a descendant of >Emperor Yan of the Shang 商炎帝 . His surname was Jiang 姜. He counted as the most luan 亂 “unruly” of the nobles of his time. On the other hand he is said to have been the first to have used metal in order to produce weapons. [GUAN 77] A mythical warrior, originally also said to have been a supporter of the Yellow Emperor, he nonetheless defeated and killed by the Yellow Emperor in the battle of Zhuo Lu 涿鹿. [SJ 1.4 etc.]  A military classic is attributed to him in the bibliography of HS, but this has long been lost. According to the old commentary to the LSCQ 7.1, Chiyou was legendary leader of the 九黎 “Nine Tribes” of the East. LSCQ 7.2 explicitly rejects reports that he was the inventor of metal weaponry 人曰「蚩尤作兵」，蚩尤非作兵也. [SHU 25; SJ 1.3ff, and 28; ZHUANG 29; DDLJ 33] See Birrell, Mythology p. 296
