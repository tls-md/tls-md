# [[光宅寺]] *[[guāng zhái sì]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[MONASTERIES]]
BUDDH: 'Light-residence Monastery'. This probably refers to a monastery situated in Cháng'ān which was built in 677. There is also a more famous monastery of the same name which was built in 502 by Emperor Wǔ 武 of Liáng 梁, situated in today's Nánjīng 南京. The name derives from light-rays (guāng 光) which supposedly were ejected from a Guānyīn 觀音 statue for a period of seven days (see Foguang: 2171-2172).
