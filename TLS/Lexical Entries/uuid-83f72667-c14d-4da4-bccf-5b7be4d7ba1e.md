# [[于]] *[[yú]]*  [[uuid-2a0ded86-3b04-4488-bb7a-3efccfa35844|vadV]] [[uuid-c6f3b5cf-8d03-4c7a-8455-4d4fc324f03b|prefix]] [[CONTINUE]]
continuously; go on V-ing; perhaps also inchoative: go a-V-ing [this may have to be reanalysed as vt+V, in fact! The link with the meaning GO TO is tempting. This needs study.]
