# [[公子開方]] *[[gōng zǐ kāi fāng]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[ARISTOCRATS OF WEY]]
Prince Kāifāng 公子開方 (7th century) was a prince from Wèy 衛 but came to serve as an official in the court of >Duke Huan of Qi 齊桓公. His personality aroused sustained interest on the part of the compilers of GUAN. Recent archaeological evidence [QINGHUA 2] mentions Qi Fang 啓方 who is taken to be identical with Prince Kaifang, and who in that text is said to be none other than > Marquis Wen of Wey 衛文侯. [GUAN 18, 20 and 26]
