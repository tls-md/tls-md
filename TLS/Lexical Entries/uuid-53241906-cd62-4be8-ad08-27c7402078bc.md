BUDDH: the true mark which has no features, the true mark is No-mark (see 實相 and 無相) (this is a very popular phrase in Chán/Zen texts, expressing that the true nature of things is without any distinguishing features, and as such the true nature of all things is identical; the phrase is originally based on the DAZHI DULUN, see SOURCES; see also Wúliàng yì jīng 無量義經: “其一法者即無相也，如是無相，無相不相，不相無相，名為實相。”(T.9: 385c). The above phrases, together with wēimiào zhèngfǎ 微妙正法 'the subtle correct dharma' appear in WUMENGUAN (T.48/2005: 293c): “世尊云：‘吾有正法眼藏，涅槃妙心，實相無相，微妙法門，不立文字，教外別傳，付囑摩訶迦葉。’”'The World-honoured One said: 'I am in possession of the storehouse [?] of the true dharma-eye, the wonderful mind of nirvāṇa, the true mark which is no mark, the subtle dharma gates, the separate transmission which is not based on words and is outside the scriptural teaching, which I [now] transmit to Kāśyapa.' (on the above terms see also FOGUANG: 5789b). )
