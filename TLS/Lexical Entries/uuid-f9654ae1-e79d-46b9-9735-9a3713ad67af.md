CHEMLA 2003: refers to the reasoning or "idea" behind a mathematical procedure.Mathematical commentarial practice crucially involved not only the reconstruction of effective procedures (which would make Chinese mathematics into a mere art of calculation devoid of theoretical basis) but also the underlying 意 "idea/reasoning behind" the procedure. Thus in his introduction to JZ Liu Hui ejaculates: 總算術之根源，探賾之暇，遂悟其意 "I got an overall view of the underlying principles of the (various) procedures of mathematics, and while taking a rest from the exploration of these mysteries, in the end, in a sudden moment of insight, I got their basic ideas/the underlying reasonings!".Liu Hui writes in his postface about 古人之意 "the underlying idea of the ancients (i.e. concerning the 重差 procedure)", thus there is a historical as well as a systematic motivation behind his quest for the underlying idea.This historical underlying reasoning/idea may be ancient or not, but in any case it may be wrong: JZ, Liu Hui's comm 4.24: 此意非也 "this reasoning is mistaken".
