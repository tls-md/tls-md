BUDDH: the Yùquán (Yuquan) monastery is situated in today's Jiānglíng 江陵 district of Húběi 湖北 (during the Tang part of Jīng 荊 province). The temple dates back to the Six Dynasties period. The temple is famous for having been the place where the famous Tiāntái monk Zhìyǐ 智顗 wrote the Móhē zhǐguān 摩訶止觀 ('Concentration and Contemplation in Mahāyāna Buddhism' and a commentary to the LOTUS (Fǎhuá xuányì 法華玄義). Also the Northern Chán school founder Shénxiù 神秀 took residence there (see YANAGIDA 1990: 396, fn. 269)
