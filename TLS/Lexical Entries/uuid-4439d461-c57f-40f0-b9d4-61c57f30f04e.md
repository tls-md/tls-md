 - [[靈樞經]] 窘乎哉問也 / A difficult question, indeed! The five long-term depots, with them [man] correspondsto heaven and earth. They are associated with [the dynamics of ] yin andyang [qi]. They correspond to the four seasons and they are transformed in accordancewith the five sections [of the five phases]. Among the five long-term depotsthere are small and big ones, those located above and others located below. Thosethat are hard and others that are brittle, those that stand upright and others that areinclined. Among the six short-term repositories, too, there are small and big ones,long and short ones, thick and thin ones, curved and straight ones, relaxed and tenseones. All these 255 are different. Some are good, others are malign. Their signs maybe auspicious or inauspicious. I ask for permission to speak about the backgroundof all of this.6[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=CH1d0952_CHANT_047-1a.55)
