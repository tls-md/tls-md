# [[銀輪王]] *[[yín lún wáng]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[BUDDHIST DEITIES]]
BUDDH: Silver wheel-turning king (also: Yín-lún shèng wáng 銀輪聖王). Muller: 'In pre-Buddhist Indian tradition, this refers to a sage, benevolent and capable ruler, who eminently handles the domain; somewhat of an ideal, mythical vision of the perfect king, who is able to rule by righteousness rather than by force. In Buddhism, a special meaning is implied, with this ruler possessing a buddhas enlightenment and abilities. In particular, there are four kings, who possess gold, silver, bronze and iron wheels respectively.' (SANSKRIT cakravarti-rāja). The Gold wheel-turning king (Jīn-lún wáng 金輪王) is the highest of these kings.
