# [[智皇]] *[[zhì huáng]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[ZEN MONKS]]
BUDDH: Zhìhuáng (Zhihuang) chánshī 智皇禪師: compare ZONGJINGLU 宗鏡錄: Zhìhuáng chán-shī 智隍禪師. This version of the name appears also in JINGDECHUANDENGLU and WUDENG. He started his career as a monk under the guidance of the Fifth Patriarch. After this initial period he moved to Hénán and practiced meditation in solitude for a period of more than twenty years. Afterwards he is said to have joined the assembly of the Sixth Patriarch where he finally gained enlightenment. After having returned to Héběi he spent the rest of his life teaching Buddhism (see JINGDECHUANDENGLU, fasc. 5; BUDDHIST NAMES: 757)
