 - [[文選]] 別**來**行復四年。
                     / ■►►▼▼►　Since we parted1  soon another2 four years will have gone.3----1The letter refers back to where the common experience with the addressee has stopped.  This is perfectly current in the genre, of course.  But we seem to have a demonstratively colloquial phrase in bié lái 別來, where lái  來 is semi-grammaticalised, unstressed.2Time passes at a disconcerting rate.  Yet another four years gone.  Lǐ Shàn 李善 was already worried about the use of xíng 行 in this place and glosses it as qiě 且 "be about to".  3Begins with time concepts and ends this sequence with them. Almost chiastic.  But the tonal pattern as well as the diction are informal, almost talkative. In clear contrast with the gnomic first line.[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR4h0001_tls_042-8a.6)
