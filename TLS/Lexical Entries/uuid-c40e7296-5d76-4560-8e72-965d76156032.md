# [[成歡]] *[[chéng huān]]*  [[uuid-c43c0bab-2810-42a4-a6be-e4641d9b6632|NPpr]] [[ARISTOCRATS OF QI]]
Chéng Huān 成驩 (early 3rd century), also written 成歡, was a courtier in the state of Qi 齊, probably during the reign of >King Min of Qi 齊湣王 (323 – 284, r. 300 – 284). Chéng Huān is said to have thought the state of Qí was weak as a result of excessive kind-heartedness. He is unattested outside HF 30.26.
