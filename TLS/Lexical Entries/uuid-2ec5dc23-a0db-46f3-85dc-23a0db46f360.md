 - [[文選]] 雖**書疏**往返，
                     / ►►►▲▲ Even if1 letters and memorials2 go back and forth,3----1Cao does not say zòng 縱 "although": suī 雖 remains hypothetical in its  "pregnant" uses.2At least from Han times onwards the shū 疏 were a recognised genre of submissions to the authorities.  We must remember Cao Pi's high status as fù chéngxiàng 副承相. Shū 書 *qhlja is in fact not homophonous with shū 疏 *sqra: the words have different initials in Qièyùn 切韻 and Pan Wuyun has very different Old Chinese reconstructions.3The people ought to be going back and forth.  The letters are not proper subjects of this going back and forth.   This is a point at which Cao gets close to metaphorical diction. -ang and -an are pleasingly close and one needs to see to what extent these endings are felt to be approximate rhymes.[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR4h0001_tls_042-8a.11)
