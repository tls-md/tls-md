Bīn Xūwú 賓胥無 (7th century) was a tailor in the court of >Duke Huan of Qi 齊桓公, mentioned in HF 37. GUAN 18.1 has him - together with >Xi Peng 隰朋 (d. 645)- remonstrating with >Duke Huan of Qi. Throughout GUAN he is celebrated as one of the da fu 大夫 “dignitaries” (including prime minister >Guan Zhong 管仲 (d. 643)) who are taken to have been instrumental in the rise and the political success of Duke Huan of Qi. [GUAN 26, 51, 81, 83]
