# [[佛心宗]] *[[fó xīn zōng]]*  [[uuid-db0698e7-db2f-4ee3-9a20-0c2b2e0cebf0|NPab]] [[BUDDHIST SCHOOLS]]
BUDDH: Buddha-mind doctrine/school (an alternative name for the Chán/Zen schools; the origin of this reference is probably VIMALAKIRTI: 佛語心為宗; the term fits well into the doctrinal framework of the 'transmission from mind to mind' (以心傳心) and the rejection of teachings only based on written sources. The term also appears in PLATFORM and BIYANLU, etc.)
