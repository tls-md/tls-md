the whole clan, all the members of one's clan in the broadest sense of the term (NB: It remains an open question whether this term refers to the group as a whole, as one thing, or to the menmbers of the group, as a plural term. I.e. the question is whether the Chinese hypostatised or reified a family or clan "as such".)
