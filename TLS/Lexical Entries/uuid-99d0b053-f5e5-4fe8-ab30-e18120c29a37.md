 - [[文選]] 別**來**行復四年。
                     / ■►►▼▼►　Since we parted1  soon another2 four years will have gone.3----1The letter refers back to where the common experience with the addressee has stopped.  This is perfectly current in the genre, of course.  But we seem to have a demonstratively colloquial phrase in bié lái 別來, where lái  來 is semi-grammaticalised, unstressed.2Time passes at a disconcerting rate.  Yet another four years gone.  Lǐ Shàn 李善 was already worried about the use of xíng 行 in this place and glosses it as qiě 且 "be about to".  3Begins with time concepts and ends this sequence with them. Almost chiastic.  But the tonal pattern as well as the diction are informal, almost talkative.
