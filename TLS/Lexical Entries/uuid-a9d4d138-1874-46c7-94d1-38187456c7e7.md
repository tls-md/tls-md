 - [[孟子]] 猶**棬**棬也 / 好比杯盘；[HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR1h0001_tls_011-1a.6)
 - [[孟子]] 猶以杞柳為**棬**棬 / is like making a willow tree into cups and bowls.”[Zhu Xi comments, “Gaozi means that human nature fundamentally lacks benevolence and righteousness and must await straightening and bending before it can become complete. This is like Xunzi’s theory that ‘human nature is bad.’” (Xunzi was a later Confucian critical of Mengzi. He compared ethical cultivation to “steaming and bending . . . woodstraight as a plumb line into a wheel.”)1][HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR1h0001_tls_011-2a.1)
