# [[表]] *[[biǎo]]*  [[uuid-76be1df4-3d73-4e5f-bbc2-729542645bc8|nab]] [[uuid-b110bae1-02d5-4c66-ad13-7c04b3ee3ad9|mathematical term]] [[OUTSIDE]]
CHEMLA 2003: outside, exterior part of a mathematical figure. This concept is in this specific sense is particularly common in the commentaries JZ 9, whereas the meaning "gnomon" is attested in the main text of that chapter. The more general meaning "outside" is not specifically relevant to mathematics. When one square is marked out within another as in [ILL 1], the unmarked rectilinear part of the original square is referred to by the technical term jǔ 矩, and this kind of remaining shape in general is called the biǎo 表. In JZ 9.24 矩之表 refers to the remaining part in the shape of (two) jǔ 矩.
