BUDDH: Earth God; skr. Pṛthivī (god who controls the earth; more commonly known as Dìtiān 地天; also referred to as Jiānláo dìshén 堅牢地神, Jiānláo dìtiān 堅牢地天, Chídì shén 持地神) (one of the twelve devas (十二天); according to Buddhist legend, when Buddha was about to be enlightened, this spirit appeared and drove away the forces of Māra; consequently stayed with Buddha for a period and afterwards spread the Buddhist teachings in the Heavens, becoming one of the guardian gods of Buddhism; the description of the spirit differs very much according to several Buddhist scriptures, some describing the spirit as having male gender, others as being female)
