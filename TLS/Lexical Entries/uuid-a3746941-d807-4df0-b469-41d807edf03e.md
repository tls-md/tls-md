 - [[孟子]] 然而孟施**守**守約也 / Nonetheless, Meng Shishe preserved something crucial. [Zixia had a reputation for being intelligent and learned, but cold and perhaps lacking in personal commitment to the Way(Analects 3.8 and 6.13). Zhu Xi comments, “Bogong You concentrated on his enemy. Meng Shishe focused on maintaining himself. Zixia had firm faith in Kongzi. Zengzi ‘sought for it in himself’ (2A7, 4A4; Analects 15.21). Hence, although Bogong You and Meng Shishe are not ona level with Zengzi and Zixia, nonetheless, in terms of the manifestation of their qi, each resembles one of them in a certain respect. Between the former two, Mengzi does not know whose courage is preferable. But in terms of what they preserve, Meng Shishe gets what is more crucial than does Bogong You.” (On qi, see the commentary on2A2.8.)][HXWD](https://hxwd.org/textview.html?location=KR1h0001_tls_003-12a.28)
