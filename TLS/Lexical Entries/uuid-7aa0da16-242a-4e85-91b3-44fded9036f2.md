# [[有情]] *[[yǒu qíng]]*  [[uuid-080d3352-c9b3-40b5-8aed-7996007863d9|NP[adN]]] [[CREATURE]]
BUDDH: endowed with sensation > sentient being (as opposed to 無情 inanimate things) (this term for sattva was introduced by Xuánzàng 玄奘 (600-664), although the older term zhòngshēng 眾生 remained more popular; originally both terms were a translation of the same Sanskrit word but eventually yǒuqíng came to be used paricularily for creatures with mental activities, whereas zhòngshēng can be used more generally for 'living being', including plant life; the term yǒuqíng is also less neutral, since it gives also emphasis to the notion of qíng 情, i.e. that living beings (particularily human beings) are characterized by deluded mental activities); SANSKRIT sattva
