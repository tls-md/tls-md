# [[六塵]] *[[liù chén]]*  [[uuid-db0698e7-db2f-4ee3-9a20-0c2b2e0cebf0|NPab]] [[uuid-2e7204ae-4771-435b-82ff-310068296b6d|buddhist]] [[DUST]]
BUDDH: the six sense objects (色 form, 聲, sound, 香 smell, 味 flavour, 觸 touch), which come in contact with the six senses (liùgēn 六根) and produce the six consciousnesses (liùshí 六識); this contact defiles the mind therefore the sense objects are also referred to as the Six Dusts 六塵; sometimes also referred to as the Six Thieves 六賊 since they snatch away all good dharmas; sometimes also referred as the wàichén 外塵 'External pollutions' since - although they defile the mind - they cannot infiltrate the pure mind (zhēnxīn 真心) the six kinds of dust; Six Dusts > the six sense objects (which - through contact with the six senses - defile the pure mind; see the more current 六境)
